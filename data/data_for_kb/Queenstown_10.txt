As a family with two children, aged 5 and 7, we recently visited Queenstown, New Zealand, and had an incredible time. Here are some of the top attractions and activities we recommend for families with kids:

1. The Skyline Gondola and Luge: This was one of our favorite activities in Queenstown. The gondola ride up the mountain offers stunning views of the city and Lake Wakatipu. Once at the top, there are several restaurants and cafes to choose from, as well as a luge track that the kids loved. The luge is a fun and safe way for kids to experience the thrill of racing down a mountain, and there are different tracks to suit different ages and abilities.

2. The Queenstown Gardens: This beautiful park is located right in the heart of Queenstown and is a great place to take a break from the hustle and bustle of the city. There are plenty of picnic spots, walking trails, and playgrounds for kids to enjoy. The park also has a beautiful rose garden and a small lake where you can feed the ducks.

3. The Queenstown Hill Time Walk: This is a great activity for families who love the outdoors. The hike up Queenstown Hill takes about 2-3 hours round trip and offers stunning views of the city and surrounding mountains. The trail is well-marked and relatively easy, making it suitable for families with young children. At the top, there is a viewing platform where you can take in the breathtaking views.

4. The Queenstown Bike Park: This is a great activity for families who love cycling. The bike park has a range of trails suitable for all ages and abilities, from easy beginner trails to challenging black diamond runs. There are also plenty of rental shops in town where you can rent bikes and equipment. The kids loved the thrill of riding down the mountain, and we all had a great time exploring the different trails.

5. The Shotover Jet: This is a high-speed boat ride that takes you through the Shotover River Canyon. The ride is fast and exhilarating, and the kids loved the thrill of speeding through the narrow canyons. The Shotover Jet is suitable for all ages, and there are plenty of opportunities to take photos and enjoy the scenery.

Overall, we had an amazing time in Queenstown and would highly recommend it as a family-friendly destination. There are plenty of activities and attractions to keep kids of all ages entertained, and the scenery is simply breathtaking. We can't wait to go back and explore more of this beautiful city!
