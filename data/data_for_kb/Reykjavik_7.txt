I'm 47 years old, and I recently went to Reykjavik with my pets. I'm here to tell you about my experience and suggest some fun things to do with your pets in Reykjavik.

First, let me tell you about the pet-friendly accommodations I found in Reykjavik. I stayed at the Reykjavik Residence Hotel, which allows pets for an additional fee. The hotel was clean, comfortable, and the staff was very friendly and accommodating to my pets. They even provided a pet bed and food bowls for my furry friends.

Now, let's talk about the fun things to do with your pets in Reykjavik. Here are my top 5 recommendations:

1. Hallgrimskirkja Church: This iconic church is a must-see in Reykjavik, and it's pet-friendly! You can take your pet inside the church and admire the stunning architecture. Just be sure to keep your pet on a leash and clean up after them.

2. Reykjavik City Pond: This pond is a popular spot for locals and tourists alike, and it's also pet-friendly. You can take your pet for a walk around the pond, and they can even go for a swim if they want to. There are plenty of benches where you can sit and relax while your pet plays.

3. Reykjavik Zoo and Family Park: This zoo is a great place to take your pets for a day of fun. They have a petting zoo where you can interact with farm animals, and there are plenty of open spaces where your pets can run and play. Just be sure to keep them on a leash and clean up after them.

4. Reykjavik Maritime Museum: This museum is a great place to learn about Iceland's maritime history, and it's also pet-friendly! You can take your pet inside the museum, and they can even sit with you while you watch the short film about Iceland's fishing industry. Just be sure to keep them quiet and well-behaved.

5. Laugardalur Park: This park is a great place to take your pets for a walk or a run. It has plenty of open spaces, walking trails, and even a petting zoo. Just be sure to keep your pets on a leash and clean up after them.

Overall, I had a great time in Reykjavik with my pets. The city is very pet-friendly, and there are plenty of things to do with your furry friends. I highly recommend visiting Hallgrimskirkja Church, Reykjavik City Pond, Reykjavik Zoo and Family Park, Reykjavik Maritime Museum, and Laugardalur Park.
