Hi there! I'm Sarah, a 28-year-old solo traveler who recently visited Queenstown, New Zealand. I had an amazing time exploring this beautiful city and want to share some of my favorite attractions and activities with you.

First up is the Skyline Gondola and Luge. The gondola ride up the mountain offers breathtaking views of Queenstown and Lake Wakatipu. Once you reach the top, you can enjoy a meal at the restaurant or grab a drink at the bar. But the real fun starts with the luge! It's a thrilling ride down the mountain on a small cart, with twists and turns that will keep you on your toes. There are three different tracks to choose from, so you can go as fast or as slow as you like. It's a great way to meet other travelers and have some fun.

Next, I recommend taking a day trip to Milford Sound. This stunning fiord is located in Fiordland National Park and is a must-see for anyone visiting Queenstown. You can take a bus tour or rent a car and drive yourself. The drive is beautiful, with plenty of stops along the way to take in the scenery. Once you arrive at Milford Sound, you can take a boat tour and see the waterfalls, wildlife, and towering cliffs up close. It's an unforgettable experience that you won't want to miss.

If you're looking for a thrill, then bungee jumping is a must-do in Queenstown. The Kawarau Bridge Bungee is the world's first commercial bungee jump and is a great option for solo travelers. The staff is friendly and supportive, and they make sure you feel comfortable before taking the plunge. It's an adrenaline rush like no other, and you'll feel a sense of accomplishment once you've done it.

For a more relaxed activity, I recommend taking a walk around Lake Wakatipu. The lake is beautiful and offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains. You can walk along the lakefront or take a hike up one of the nearby trails. It's a great way to get some exercise and enjoy the fresh air.

Finally, I recommend taking a wine tour in the nearby Gibbston Valley. This area is known for its world-class Pinot Noir and is home to several vineyards and wineries. You can take a guided tour or rent a bike and explore on your own. The wineries offer tastings and tours, and you can learn about the wine-making process while enjoying a glass or two. It's a great way to unwind after a day of adventure.

Overall, I highly recommend Queenstown for solo travelers. There's so much to see and do, and the city has a friendly and welcoming vibe. I hope this review has given you some ideas for your trip and that you have as much fun as I did!
