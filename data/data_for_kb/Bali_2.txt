Hi! I'm Jenny, a 35-year-old mother of two. I recently visited Bali with my family, and I'm excited to share our experiences with you. Here are some of the popular tourist attractions and fun things to do in Bali that we enjoyed:

1. Tanah Lot Temple: This temple is a must-visit for any family traveling to Bali. It's located on a rock formation in the sea, and the views are breathtaking. We visited during sunset, and the temple was lit up, creating a magical atmosphere. The temple is also home to many monkeys, which my kids loved feeding and playing with.

2. Ubud Monkey Forest: If your kids love animals, then the Ubud Monkey Forest is a must-visit. It's home to over 700 monkeys, and you can get up close and personal with them. We spent hours watching the monkeys play and climb trees. The forest also has beautiful walking trails and temples, making it a great place to explore.

3. Bali Zoo: The Bali Zoo is a great place to take your kids if they love animals. It's home to over 450 animals, including elephants, tigers, and orangutans. We took a guided tour of the zoo and got to feed some of the animals. The zoo also offers a night safari, which is a unique experience that we highly recommend.

4. Bali Safari and Marine Park: This park is another great option for families who love animals. It's home to over 60 different species, including lions, tigers, and rhinos. We took a safari tour of the park and got to see many of the animals up close. The park also has a water park and a theater, making it a great place to spend a full day.

5. Waterbom Bali: If you're looking for a fun day out with your family, then Waterbom Bali is the place to go. It's one of the largest water parks in Asia and has over 20 different slides and attractions. We spent the entire day there and had a blast. The park also has a lazy river, which was perfect for my younger kids.

Bali is a beautiful island with so much to offer families. We had an amazing time exploring the temples, interacting with animals, and having fun at the water parks. I highly recommend visiting Bali with your family and experiencing all that this incredible island has to offer.
