As a 35-year-old traveling with my two dogs, I was excited to explore New York City and find pet-friendly attractions. Here are some of the places I visited and would recommend for other pet owners:

Central Park is a must-visit for any traveler, and it's also a great place to bring your pets. There are plenty of trails to walk your dog, and you can even rent a boat and take your pet out on the lake. The park is huge, so there's plenty of space for your pet to run around and explore. Just be sure to keep them on a leash and clean up after them.

The High Line is a unique park built on an old railway line. It's a great place to take a stroll with your pet and enjoy the views of the city. There are plenty of benches to sit on and take a break, and you can even grab a bite to eat at one of the nearby food trucks. Just be sure to keep your pet on a leash and clean up after them.

The Brooklyn Bridge is another iconic New York City landmark that's great for walking with your pet. The views of the city are stunning, and there are plenty of places to stop and take photos. Just be sure to keep your pet on a leash and stay on the pedestrian path.

The Battery Park City Dog Run is a great place to let your pet run off-leash and socialize with other dogs. It's a large, fenced-in area with plenty of room to run and play. There's also a separate area for smaller dogs, so everyone can have a good time.

Finally, I recommend checking out the pet-friendly restaurants and cafes in the city. There are plenty of places that welcome pets, such as Shake Shack and Barking Dog. Just be sure to call ahead and confirm that they allow pets before you go.

Overall, I had a great time exploring New York City with my pets. There are plenty of pet-friendly attractions and activities to enjoy, and the city is very welcoming to pets. Just be sure to keep your pet on a leash and clean up after them, and you'll have a great time.
