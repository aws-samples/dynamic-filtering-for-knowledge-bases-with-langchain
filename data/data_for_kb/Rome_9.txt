As a solo traveler in my early 30s, I recently spent a week in Rome, and I can confidently say that it is a fantastic destination for those traveling alone. Here are some of my top recommendations for things to do and see in Rome:

The Colosseum: This iconic landmark is a must-visit for any traveler to Rome. I recommend purchasing tickets in advance to avoid long lines, and consider taking a guided tour to learn more about the history of this incredible structure. The Colosseum is an awe-inspiring sight, and it's easy to spend hours wandering around and taking in the views.

The Vatican Museums: Even if you're not particularly religious, the Vatican Museums are worth a visit for their incredible art and architecture. The Sistine Chapel is, of course, a highlight, but there are also many other incredible works of art to see, including the Raphael Rooms and the Gallery of Maps. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes, as the museums are vast and there is a lot of ground to cover.

The Trevi Fountain: This stunning fountain is a popular spot for tourists, and it's easy to see why. The fountain is beautifully lit up at night, making it a great place to visit after dark. Be sure to toss a coin into the fountain to ensure your return to Rome!

The Pantheon: This ancient temple is one of the best-preserved buildings in Rome, and it's an incredible sight to behold. The massive dome and oculus are truly impressive, and the interior of the building is incredibly peaceful. It's a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and take a moment to reflect.

Trastevere: This charming neighborhood is located on the west bank of the Tiber River and is known for its narrow streets, colorful buildings, and lively atmosphere. It's a great place to wander around and explore, and there are plenty of cafes and restaurants to choose from. I recommend trying some of the local cuisine, such as carbonara or cacio e pepe.

In conclusion, Rome is a fantastic destination for solo travelers, with plenty of things to see and do. Whether you're interested in history, art, food, or just soaking up the atmosphere of this incredible city, you're sure to have a great time. Just be sure to wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to do a lot of walking!
