You can take an elevator to the top of the church for a small fee, which offers panoramic views of the city.

3. Harpa Concert Hall: This stunning concert hall is located on the waterfront and is a must-visit attraction in Reykjavik. The building's unique architecture and glass facade make it a popular spot for tourists and locals alike. The concert hall hosts various events, including concerts, operas, and theater performances, so be sure to check the schedule and see if anything interests you.
