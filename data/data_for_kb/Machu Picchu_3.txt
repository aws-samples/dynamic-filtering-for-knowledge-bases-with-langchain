As a mother of two young children, I recently visited Machu Picchu with my family and wanted to share my experience. We had an incredible time exploring this ancient Incan city and found plenty of activities to keep us all entertained. Here are some of our favorite things to do in Machu Picchu with kids:

1. Hike to the Sun Gate: This is a moderate hike that takes about two hours round trip. The views of Machu Picchu from the Sun Gate are breathtaking, and it's a great way to get some exercise while enjoying the beautiful scenery. My kids loved the challenge of the hike and were thrilled when we finally reached the top.

2. Visit the Temple of the Sun: This is one of the most famous structures in Machu Picchu and is a must-see for anyone visiting the site. The temple is built around a large rock and features intricate stonework and carvings. My kids were fascinated by the history of the temple and loved exploring the different rooms and passageways.

3. Take a guided tour: We found that taking a guided tour of Machu Picchu was a great way to learn about the history and culture of the Incas. Our guide was very knowledgeable and kept the kids engaged with stories and facts about the site. He also helped us navigate the crowds and find the best spots for taking photos.

4. Explore the terraces: Machu Picchu is famous for its terraced fields, which were used by the Incas for growing crops. The terraces are a great place to take a break from the crowds and enjoy the beautiful scenery. My kids loved running around on the terraces and pretending to be farmers.

5. Visit the Inca Bridge: This is a short hike from the main site and offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains. The Inca Bridge is a narrow path built into the side of a cliff and is not for the faint of heart. However, my kids loved the adventure of crossing the bridge and the thrill of looking down at the valley below.

Overall, we had an amazing time in Machu Picchu and would highly recommend it for families with children. There is so much to see and do, and the site is truly breathtaking. Just be sure to pack plenty of water, sunscreen, and comfortable shoes, as there is a lot of walking involved.
