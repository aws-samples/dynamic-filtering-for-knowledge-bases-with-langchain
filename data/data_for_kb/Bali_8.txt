I am a 35-year-old mother of two children, ages 7 and 9. I recently visited Bali with my family and wanted to share my experience with you. Bali is a beautiful island with a lot to offer, especially for families with children. Here are some of the popular tourist attractions and fun things to do in Bali that we enjoyed.

First, we visited the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary in Ubud. It was an unforgettable experience for our children to see the monkeys up close. The sanctuary is a beautiful forest with ancient temples and statues. We were able to feed the monkeys and take pictures with them. It was a unique experience that our children still talk about.

Next, we went to the Tegallalang Rice Terraces. The rice terraces are a stunning sight to see, with lush green rice paddies and beautiful views of the surrounding mountains. We took a leisurely walk through the terraces and enjoyed the fresh air and peaceful atmosphere. Our children loved running around and exploring the rice paddies.

Another popular tourist attraction in Bali is the Bali Zoo. The zoo is home to a variety of animals, including elephants, tigers, and orangutans. Our children enjoyed feeding the elephants and watching the orangutans swing from tree to tree. The zoo also has a playground and a petting zoo, which our children loved.

Finally, we visited the Tanah Lot Temple. The temple is located on a rock formation in the ocean and is one of the most iconic landmarks in Bali. We watched the sunset over the ocean and took in the beautiful views. Our children loved exploring the temple and learning about the history and culture of Bali.

In conclusion, Bali is a great destination for families with children. There are plenty of fun things to do and see, and the island has a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. We highly recommend visiting the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary, the Tegallalang Rice Terraces, the Bali Zoo, and the Tanah Lot Temple. We hope to return to Bali soon and explore more of what the island has to offer.
