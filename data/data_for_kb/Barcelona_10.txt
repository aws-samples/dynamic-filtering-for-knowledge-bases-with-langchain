I recently visited Barcelona with my family, including my two children aged 10 and 7. We had a fantastic time exploring the city and discovering all the fun things to do with kids. Here are some of our favorite attractions and activities:

Park Guell: This park, designed by Antoni Gaudi, is a must-visit for families. The colorful mosaics and whimsical sculptures are sure to capture the imagination of children of all ages. There are plenty of open spaces for kids to run around and play, and the views of the city from the park are breathtaking. We spent a whole afternoon here, exploring the different areas and taking in the sights.

Barcelona Zoo: This zoo is a great place to take kids, with a wide variety of animals to see, including lions, tigers, elephants, and penguins. The zoo also has a petting zoo where kids can interact with some of the animals, and a playground where they can burn off some energy. We spent a few hours here, and our kids loved every minute of it.

Barcelona Aquarium: This aquarium is one of the largest in Europe and is home to over 11,000 marine animals. The highlight for our kids was the shark tunnel, where they could walk through a glass tunnel surrounded by sharks swimming overhead. There are also plenty of interactive exhibits and activities, such as touch pools where kids can touch starfish and sea urchins.

Beach Day: Barcelona has some beautiful beaches, and we spent a day relaxing and playing in the sand. The water was warm and inviting, and our kids loved building sandcastles and playing in the waves. There are also plenty of restaurants and cafes along the beach, so we were able to grab a bite to eat without having to leave the beach.

Food Tour: We took a food tour of the city, which was a great way to sample some of Barcelona's famous cuisine. Our kids loved trying new foods, such as paella, tapas, and churros. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and gave us a lot of interesting information about the city and its food culture.

Overall, we had a fantastic time in Barcelona and would highly recommend it as a family-friendly destination. There are plenty of fun things to do with kids, from exploring parks and zoos to trying new foods and relaxing on the beach. We can't wait to go back and discover even more of what this amazing city has to offer!
