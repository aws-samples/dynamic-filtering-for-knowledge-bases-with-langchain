As a solo traveler in my early 30s, I recently visited Rome and had an incredible time exploring the city's rich history, culture, and cuisine. Here are some of my top recommendations for solo travelers looking to make the most of their trip to Rome:

First and foremost, I recommend visiting the Colosseum. This iconic landmark is a must-see for anyone visiting Rome, and it's just as impressive as you've always imagined. I recommend purchasing tickets in advance to avoid long lines, and consider taking a guided tour to learn more about the history and architecture of this incredible structure.

Next, I recommend visiting the Vatican Museums and St. Peter's Basilica. These world-renowned museums are home to some of the most impressive art and architecture in the world, including the Sistine Chapel and the Raphael Rooms. I recommend purchasing tickets in advance to avoid long lines, and consider taking a guided tour to learn more about the history and significance of these incredible works of art.

If you're looking for a more relaxed and authentic experience, I recommend exploring Rome's charming neighborhoods, such as Trastevere and Monti. These neighborhoods are filled with narrow streets, quaint cafes, and local shops, and they offer a glimpse into the everyday life of Romans. I recommend taking a leisurely stroll through these neighborhoods, stopping to enjoy a coffee or a glass of wine along the way.

Finally, I recommend taking a cooking class to learn how to make some of Rome's most famous dishes, such as carbonara and cacio e pepe. There are many cooking schools in Rome that offer classes for all levels of experience, and they're a great way to meet other travelers and learn about the local cuisine.

Overall, I highly recommend visiting Rome as a solo traveler. The city is incredibly welcoming and easy to navigate, and there are endless opportunities to explore its rich history, culture, and cuisine. Whether you're interested in art, architecture, food, or simply soaking up the local atmosphere, Rome has something for everyone.
