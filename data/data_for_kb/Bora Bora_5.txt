As a 30-year-old traveling with my two dogs, I was initially hesitant to visit Bora Bora. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the island is actually quite pet-friendly, with plenty of activities and attractions that cater to both humans and their furry companions. Here are some of my top recommendations for anyone planning a trip to Bora Bora with their pets:

First and foremost, I would recommend booking a pet-friendly overwater bungalow. These bungalows are not only luxurious and comfortable but also offer easy access to the water for your pets to swim and play. Many resorts on the island, such as the Four Seasons Bora Bora and the St. Regis Bora Bora Resort, offer pet-friendly accommodations, so be sure to check with the resort before booking.

Another must-visit attraction is the Bora Bora Lagoonarium. This marine park is home to a variety of fish, sharks, and rays, and offers a unique opportunity to swim and snorkel with your pets. The park also has a petting zoo, where you can interact with local animals such as turtles, eels, and parrots. Just be sure to keep your pets on a leash at all times and follow the park's rules and regulations.

For a more relaxed activity, I would recommend taking a pet-friendly boat tour of the lagoon. Many tour operators on the island offer pet-friendly tours, where you can explore the lagoon and its surrounding islands with your pets by your side. Just be sure to bring plenty of water and snacks for your pets, as well as a life jacket if they are not strong swimmers.

If you're looking for a more active adventure, I would recommend hiking Mount Otemanu. This challenging hike offers stunning views of the island and its surrounding waters, and is a great way to get some exercise with your pets. Just be sure to bring plenty of water and snacks for both you and your pets, as well as a leash and collar to keep them safe.

Finally, I would recommend visiting the Bora Bora Animal Sanctuary. This non-profit organization is dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating injured and orphaned animals on the island, and offers a unique opportunity to interact with local wildlife such as turtles, sharks, and rays. Just be sure to follow the sanctuary's rules and regulations, and keep your pets on a leash at all times.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by how pet-friendly Bora Bora is. With plenty of activities and attractions to choose from, it's the perfect destination for anyone looking to travel with their furry companions. Just be sure to do your research and plan ahead to ensure a safe and enjoyable trip for both you and your pets.
