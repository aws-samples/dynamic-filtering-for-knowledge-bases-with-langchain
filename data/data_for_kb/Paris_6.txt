As a 70-year-old retiree, I recently had the pleasure of visiting Paris for the first time. It was a trip I had been looking forward to for years, and I was not disappointed. Here are some of my favorite attractions and activities that I would recommend to other seniors visiting the city.

First on my list is the Eiffel Tower. This iconic landmark is a must-see for anyone visiting Paris, and the views from the top are truly breathtaking. While there are stairs to the second level, I opted for the elevator, which was a bit pricier but much more comfortable for someone of my age. I recommend booking tickets in advance to avoid long lines.

Next up is the Louvre Museum. This museum is massive, so I recommend picking a few galleries that interest you and focusing on those. I spent most of my time in the Egyptian and Greek galleries, which were absolutely fascinating. The museum also offers guided tours and audio guides, which can be helpful for navigating the vast collection.

Another highlight of my trip was a visit to the Palace of Versailles. This grand palace is located just outside of Paris and is easily accessible by train. I recommend taking a guided tour to learn more about the history of the palace and its famous residents, including King Louis XIV. The gardens are also worth exploring, with beautiful fountains and sculptures.

For a more relaxed activity, I suggest taking a stroll along the Seine River. There are plenty of benches and cafes along the way where you can stop and rest, and the views of the city are stunning. I also recommend taking a boat tour of the river, which offers a unique perspective of Paris's famous landmarks.

Finally, I would recommend visiting Montmartre, a charming neighborhood in the north of Paris. This area is known for its bohemian vibe and stunning views of the city. I recommend taking a walking tour to learn more about the history of the area and see some of its famous landmarks, including the Sacre-Coeur Basilica.

In conclusion, Paris is a city that has something for everyone, including seniors. With so many attractions and activities to choose from, it's easy to plan a trip that suits your interests and abilities. Whether you're interested in history, art, or simply taking in the sights, Paris is a city that will not disappoint.
