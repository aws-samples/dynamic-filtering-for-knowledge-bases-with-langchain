As a 30-year-old solo traveler, I recently visited Machu Picchu and was blown away by the beauty and history of this ancient Incan city. Here are my top recommendations for things to do and see in Machu Picchu:

First and foremost, make sure to hike Huayna Picchu. This challenging hike takes you to the top of the mountain that towers over Machu Picchu, offering breathtaking views of the entire site. The hike is steep and narrow in places, but the sense of accomplishment you feel when you reach the top is well worth the effort.

Next, take a guided tour of the main ruins. Machu Picchu is a complex and intricate site, and a knowledgeable guide can help you make sense of the history and significance of each structure. I recommend taking a small group tour, as this allows for a more personalized experience and plenty of opportunities to ask questions.

If you're interested in learning more about the Incas, be sure to visit the Machu Picchu Museum. This museum is located in Aguas Calientes, the town at the base of the mountain, and features exhibits on Incan history, culture, and architecture. It's a great way to gain a deeper understanding of the site and its significance.

For a more active adventure, consider hiking the Inca Trail. This iconic trail takes you through the Andes Mountains and ends at the entrance to Machu Picchu. It's a challenging hike, but the views along the way are absolutely stunning. Just be sure to book your permit well in advance, as they sell out quickly.

Finally, don't miss the chance to visit the Temple of the Sun. This circular structure is one of the most iconic buildings in Machu Picchu, and it's believed to have been used for astronomical observations. The views from the top are incredible, and it's a great place to reflect on the history and culture of the Incas.

Overall, I highly recommend visiting Machu Picchu as a solo traveler. The site is awe-inspiring, and there are plenty of opportunities to meet other travelers and make new friends. Just be sure to plan ahead, as permits and tours can book up quickly.
