As a family of four with two children aged 8 and 10, we recently visited Bora Bora and had an incredible time. Here are some of our favorite activities and attractions that we would recommend to other families:

First on our list is the Lagoonarium. This underwater park is a must-visit for families who love marine life. We spent hours swimming with colorful fish, sea turtles, and even sharks and rays. The park is well-maintained and the staff are very knowledgeable and friendly. They provided us with snorkeling gear and even offered us the chance to feed the fish. Our kids loved it!

Next up is the Bora Bora 4x4 Safari Tour. This tour takes you on a thrilling adventure through the island's rugged terrain in a 4x4 vehicle. Our guide was very informative and showed us some of the island's most beautiful spots, including Mount Otemanu and the famous Bloody Mary's restaurant. We stopped at a local fruit stand to try some fresh pineapple and coconut, which was a real treat. The tour also included a visit to a traditional Polynesian village, where we learned about the island's history and culture.

For families who love water sports, we highly recommend the Jet Ski Tour. This tour takes you around the island on a jet ski, with stops at some of the most beautiful spots, including the famous Matira Beach. Our guide was very experienced and made sure we felt safe and comfortable at all times. We even had the chance to jump off the jet skis and swim in the crystal-clear waters. Our kids loved the thrill of riding on the jet skis and the beautiful scenery made it even more enjoyable.

If you're looking for a more relaxing activity, we recommend the Sunset Cruise. This two-hour cruise takes you around the island as the sun sets, with stops at some of the most beautiful spots, including the famous Mount Otemanu. We enjoyed a delicious dinner on board, complete with fresh seafood and tropical cocktails. The views were absolutely breathtaking and we loved watching the sunset over the island.

Finally, we recommend visiting the Bora Bora Turtle Sanctuary. This non-profit organization is dedicated to the protection and conservation of sea turtles. We had the chance to learn about the different species of sea turtles and even had the opportunity to feed them. Our kids loved getting up close and personal with these beautiful creatures and it was a great way to teach them about the importance of conservation.

In conclusion, Bora Bora is a fantastic destination for families who love adventure, beautiful scenery, and marine life. We highly recommend visiting the Lagoonarium, Bora Bora 4x4 Safari Tour, Jet Ski Tour, Sunset Cruise, and the Bora Bora Turtle Sanctuary. Our kids had a blast and we can't wait to go back!
