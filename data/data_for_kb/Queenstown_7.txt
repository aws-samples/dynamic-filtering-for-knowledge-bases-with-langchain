As a 35-year-old who loves to travel with my pets, I recently visited Queenstown, New Zealand, and was pleasantly surprised by the number of pet-friendly activities and attractions available. Here are some of my top recommendations for anyone looking to explore this beautiful city with their furry friends.

First on my list is the Queenstown Gardens. This stunning park is located right in the heart of the city and offers plenty of space for dogs to run and play. There are also several walking trails that wind through the gardens, offering beautiful views of Lake Wakatipu and the surrounding mountains. My dog loved exploring the different paths and sniffing all the new smells.

Next up is the Queenstown Trail, a network of walking and cycling trails that stretch for over 120 kilometers throughout the region. While not all of the trails are pet-friendly, there are several sections that are perfect for a leisurely stroll or bike ride with your furry friend. We particularly enjoyed the Frankton Arm Walk, which offers stunning views of the lake and the city skyline.

For those looking for a more adventurous experience, there are several pet-friendly tour companies that offer activities such as jet boating, kayaking, and even paragliding. We opted for a jet boat ride with KJet, which allowed us to bring our dog along for the ride. He loved the thrill of the high-speed turns and the spray of the water.

Finally, no trip to Queenstown would be complete without a visit to the famous Fergburger. This iconic burger joint is known for its delicious burgers and long lines, but they also offer a range of pet-friendly seating options outside. We enjoyed a delicious burger while our dog sat by our feet, enjoying the attention from the friendly staff.

Overall, I was impressed by the number of pet-friendly activities and attractions available in Queenstown. Whether you're looking for a leisurely stroll through the gardens or an adrenaline-pumping adventure, there's something for everyone in this beautiful city.
