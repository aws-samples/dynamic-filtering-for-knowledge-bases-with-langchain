As a 28-year-old solo traveler, I recently visited Dubai and had an incredible time exploring the city's many attractions. Here are some of my top recommendations for other solo travelers:

First, I recommend visiting the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building. The views from the observation deck on the 124th floor are absolutely breathtaking, and it's a great way to get a sense of the city's layout. I recommend going at sunset, as the city lights start to come on and create a beautiful glow.

Next, I recommend checking out the Dubai Mall, one of the largest malls in the world. It's a great place to shop, eat, and people-watch. There are also plenty of entertainment options, including an ice rink, a cinema, and an aquarium. I spent a few hours wandering around and exploring the different stores and attractions.

If you're looking for a more cultural experience, I recommend visiting the Dubai Museum. It's located in the Al Fahidi Fort, which is one of the oldest buildings in Dubai. The museum offers a fascinating look at the city's history and culture, from its early days as a fishing village to its current status as a global hub for business and tourism.

Another must-visit attraction is the Dubai Fountain, located in front of the Burj Khalifa. It's the world's largest choreographed fountain system, and the water shows are absolutely mesmerizing. I recommend grabbing a coffee or a snack from one of the nearby cafes and watching the show from the comfort of a patio.

Finally, I recommend taking a desert safari. There are many tour companies that offer this experience, and it's a great way to see the desert landscape and try some traditional activities like sandboarding and camel riding. I went on a sunset safari and watched the sun set over the dunes, followed by a traditional Arabic dinner and some live entertainment.

Overall, I had a fantastic time in Dubai and would highly recommend it to other solo travelers. There's so much to see and do, and the city is very safe and welcoming to visitors. I can't wait to go back and explore more!
