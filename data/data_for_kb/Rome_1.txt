As a couple in our late 30s, we recently had the pleasure of visiting Rome and wanted to share some of our favorite attractions and activities that we think other couples would enjoy.

First on our list is the Colosseum. This iconic landmark is a must-see for anyone visiting Rome, and it's even more impressive when you're there in person. We recommend taking a guided tour to learn more about the history and architecture of this ancient amphitheater. The tour we took included access to the underground tunnels and the arena floor, which was a unique and unforgettable experience.

Next, we suggest visiting the Vatican Museums. This massive complex houses an incredible collection of art and artifacts, including the famous Sistine Chapel. We spent hours wandering through the galleries, taking in the beauty of the paintings, sculptures, and tapestries. The museum can get quite crowded, so we recommend booking your tickets in advance and going early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the crowds.

Another must-see attraction is the Pantheon. This ancient temple is one of the best-preserved buildings in Rome and is a true architectural marvel. We were blown away by the size and scale of the building, as well as the intricate details of the dome and the oculus at the top. It's free to enter, so it's a great option for budget-conscious travelers.

For a more relaxed activity, we suggest taking a stroll through the Trastevere neighborhood. This charming area is known for its narrow streets, colorful buildings, and lively atmosphere. We enjoyed wandering through the streets, stopping at a local cafe for a cappuccino or a glass of wine, and people-watching from one of the many outdoor tables.

Finally, we recommend taking a cooking class together. We took a pasta-making class at a local cooking school and had a blast learning how to make traditional Italian dishes from scratch. It was a fun and interactive way to learn about Italian cuisine, and we got to enjoy our creations for dinner that night.

Overall, we had an amazing time in Rome and would highly recommend it to other couples looking for a romantic getaway. There's so much to see and do in this historic city, and we can't wait to go back and explore more.
