I'm a 35-year-old mother of two and I recently visited Reykjavik with my family. Here are some of the top attractions and activities we enjoyed during our trip:

Hallgrimskirkja Church: This iconic church is a must-visit in Reykjavik. The architecture is stunning, and the views from the top of the tower are breathtaking. My kids loved exploring the church and climbing the tower, and we all enjoyed the beautiful stained glass windows and organ music.

The Blue Lagoon: This geothermal spa is a popular destination for tourists, and for good reason. The warm, mineral-rich water is incredibly relaxing, and the surrounding landscape is beautiful. My kids loved playing in the water and trying out the different mud masks and treatments. We also enjoyed the on-site restaurant, which serves delicious Icelandic cuisine.

Reykjavik Zoo and Family Park: This zoo is a great place to take kids of all ages. It's home to a variety of animals, including reindeer, seals, and puffins, as well as a petting zoo and playground. My kids loved feeding the animals and playing on the swings and slides.

Whale Watching Tour: We took a whale watching tour with a local company, and it was an unforgettable experience. We saw several humpback whales up close, as well as dolphins and seabirds. The tour guides were knowledgeable and friendly, and they made sure everyone was safe and comfortable.

National Museum of Iceland: This museum offers a fascinating look at Iceland's history and culture. We enjoyed exploring the exhibits on Viking history, traditional Icelandic clothing, and modern Icelandic art. The museum also has a great gift shop, where we picked up some souvenirs to take home.

Overall, we had a fantastic time in Reykjavik and would highly recommend it as a family-friendly destination. There's so much to see and do, and the city is very welcoming and kid-friendly. We can't wait to go back and explore more of this beautiful country!
