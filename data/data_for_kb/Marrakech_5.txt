I'm 36 years old and I recently visited Marrakech with my family. Here are some of the popular tourist attractions and fun things to do in Marrakech for families with children:

Jardin Majorelle: This beautiful garden is a must-visit for anyone traveling to Marrakech. It was created by French painter Jacques Majorelle in the 1920s and later restored by fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent. The garden is home to a variety of exotic plants, including cacti, palms, and ferns, as well as a small museum dedicated to Berber culture. My children loved exploring the garden and taking photos in front of the vibrant blue walls.

Bahia Palace: This 19th-century palace is a great example of Moroccan architecture and design. The palace is home to beautiful courtyards, gardens, and rooms decorated with intricate tilework, carvings, and paintings. My children enjoyed exploring the palace and learning about its history.

Jemaa el-Fnaa: This bustling square in the heart of Marrakech is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. During the day, you can find vendors selling spices, textiles, and souvenirs, as well as street performers and musicians. At night, the square comes alive with food stalls serving traditional Moroccan dishes like tagine and couscous. My children loved trying the different foods and watching the street performers.

Saadian Tombs: These historic tombs are located in the Kasbah district of Marrakech and are a great example of Moroccan architecture and design. The tombs are home to the remains of the Saadian dynasty, which ruled Morocco in the 16th and 17th centuries. My children enjoyed exploring the tombs and learning about the history of the Saadian dynasty.

Quad biking in the Agafay Desert: If you're looking for a fun and adventurous activity to do with your family, consider going quad biking in the Agafay Desert. This rocky desert is located just outside of Marrakech and offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains. My children loved riding the quad bikes and exploring the desert landscape.

Overall, Marrakech is a great destination for families with children. There are plenty of activities and attractions to keep everyone entertained, and the city has a vibrant and lively atmosphere that is sure to captivate visitors of all ages.
