As a couple in our early thirties, we recently had the pleasure of visiting Dubai and were absolutely blown away by the city's beauty, culture, and endless opportunities for fun and adventure. Here are some of our top recommendations for couples visiting Dubai:

1. Dubai Mall: This massive shopping center is a must-visit for any couple who loves to shop, dine, and be entertained. With over 1,200 stores, an indoor theme park, an ice rink, and an aquarium, there's something for everyone at the Dubai Mall. We spent an entire day exploring the mall and still didn't see everything it had to offer. Our favorite part was the Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo, where we got to see sharks, stingrays, and other marine life up close.

2. Burj Khalifa: Standing at 828 meters tall, the Burj Khalifa is the tallest building in the world and offers breathtaking views of Dubai from its observation deck on the 124th floor. We recommend visiting at sunset, when the city is bathed in a warm golden light and the skyline is illuminated by the setting sun. The views from the top are simply stunning and provide a unique perspective of Dubai's modern architecture and traditional landmarks.

3. Dubai Fountain: Located just outside the Dubai Mall, the Dubai Fountain is a spectacular water, music, and light show that takes place every 30 minutes. We loved watching the fountains dance to the beat of the music and the way the lights changed color to match the mood of the music. It's a great spot for a romantic evening stroll and a perfect way to end a day of sightseeing.

4. Dubai Marina: This picturesque waterfront district is home to some of Dubai's most luxurious hotels, restaurants, and shopping centers. We loved taking a stroll along the marina and admiring the beautiful yachts and boats docked in the harbor. There are also plenty of opportunities for water sports, such as jet skiing and parasailing, if you're looking for a little adventure.

5. Desert Safari: For a truly unique experience, we recommend taking a desert safari tour. We booked a tour with a local company that picked us up from our hotel and took us on a thrilling 4x4 ride through the sand dunes. We then stopped at a traditional Bedouin camp, where we got to ride camels, smoke shisha, and enjoy a delicious barbecue dinner under the stars. It was an unforgettable experience that we would highly recommend to any couple visiting Dubai.

In conclusion, Dubai is a city that has something for everyone, and it's an ideal destination for couples looking for a romantic getaway. From the stunning architecture and world-class shopping to the delicious food and exciting adventures, there's no shortage of things to see and do in this vibrant city. We can't wait to go back and explore more of what Dubai has to offer!
