I am a 35-year-old mother of two children, aged 10 and 7. We recently visited Marrakech, and I wanted to share some of our favorite attractions and activities that we did during our stay.

One of the first places we visited was the Jardin Majorelle. This beautiful garden was created by French painter Jacques Majorelle in the 1920s and later restored by fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent. The garden is filled with exotic plants, fountains, and ponds, and there is also a museum on site that showcases Berber art and culture. Our kids loved exploring the garden and taking in all of the vibrant colors.

Another must-visit attraction in Marrakech is the Bahia Palace. This stunning palace was built in the late 19th century and is known for its intricate tilework and beautiful courtyards. Our kids were fascinated by the ornate decorations and enjoyed exploring the many rooms and corridors of the palace.

We also spent a day at the Palmeraie, a vast palm grove located just outside of the city. Here, we went on a camel ride through the palm trees and enjoyed a traditional Moroccan lunch at a local restaurant. Our kids loved riding the camels and exploring the beautiful landscape.

One of the most memorable experiences we had in Marrakech was visiting the Jemaa el-Fnaa square. This bustling square is the heart of the city and is filled with street performers, food vendors, and shops. Our kids loved watching the snake charmers and henna artists, and we all enjoyed trying some of the delicious street food, such as grilled meats and fresh juices.

Finally, we visited the Koutoubia Mosque, which is the largest mosque in Marrakech and one of the city's most iconic landmarks. While non-Muslims are not allowed inside the mosque, we were able to walk around the beautiful gardens and admire the stunning architecture from the outside.

Overall, we had a fantastic time in Marrakech and would highly recommend it as a family-friendly destination. There are so many fun things to do and see, and our kids loved experiencing the vibrant culture and history of this beautiful city.
