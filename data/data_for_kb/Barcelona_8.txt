As a family with two kids aged 8 and 10, we recently visited Barcelona and had an amazing time. Here are some of our top recommendations for family-friendly attractions and activities in this beautiful city.

First on our list is Park Guell, a whimsical park designed by Antoni Gaudi. The park is full of colorful mosaics, winding pathways, and stunning views of the city. Our kids loved exploring the park's many nooks and crannies, and we all enjoyed taking in the beautiful scenery. We spent a few hours wandering around the park, taking photos, and enjoying the fresh air.

Next up is the Barcelona Zoo, which is located in the heart of the city. The zoo is home to a wide variety of animals, including lions, tigers, elephants, and penguins. Our kids loved seeing all of the different animals and learning about their habitats. We spent a few hours walking around the zoo, taking in the sights and sounds of the animals.

Another must-visit attraction in Barcelona is the Sagrada Familia, an iconic church designed by Antoni Gaudi. The church is still under construction, but it's already a breathtaking sight to behold. Our kids were fascinated by the church's unique architecture and loved climbing up to the top of one of the towers for a panoramic view of the city.

For a fun and educational experience, we recommend visiting the Barcelona Aquarium. The aquarium is home to over 11,000 marine animals, including sharks, rays, and sea turtles. Our kids loved walking through the underwater tunnel and watching the fish swim overhead. We spent a few hours exploring the aquarium and learning about the different marine species.

Finally, we recommend taking a stroll down La Rambla, a bustling pedestrian street in the heart of Barcelona. The street is lined with shops, cafes, and street performers, and it's a great place to people-watch and soak up the local culture. Our kids loved watching the street performers and trying out some of the local treats, like churros and ice cream.

Overall, we had a fantastic time in Barcelona and would highly recommend it as a family-friendly destination. There's something for everyone in this vibrant city, from history and culture to food and fun. We can't wait to go back and explore more of what Barcelona has to offer!
