As a couple in our late 20s, we recently had the pleasure of visiting Tokyo for the first time. We were blown away by the city's vibrant energy, rich culture, and endless opportunities for fun and adventure. Here are some of our favorite attractions and activities that we would highly recommend for couples visiting Tokyo.

First on our list is the Tokyo Skytree. This towering structure is the tallest in Japan and offers breathtaking views of the city from its observation decks. We visited at night and were treated to a stunning panorama of the city's neon lights. The Skytree also has a variety of shops and restaurants, making it a great spot for a romantic dinner or a leisurely stroll.

Next up is the Meiji Shrine, a peaceful Shinto shrine located in the heart of Tokyo. The shrine is surrounded by a lush forest, providing a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. We enjoyed strolling through the grounds, admiring the beautiful architecture, and watching the traditional Shinto ceremonies. The shrine is also a popular spot for weddings, so we were lucky enough to witness a few couples exchanging vows.

Another must-visit attraction is the Senso-ji Temple in Asakusa. This ancient temple is one of Tokyo's most famous landmarks and is a great place to experience traditional Japanese culture. We loved exploring the temple's grounds, visiting the nearby Nakamise shopping street, and trying our hand at calligraphy at one of the many souvenir shops.

For a taste of Tokyo's modern side, we recommend visiting the Odaiba district. This man-made island is home to a variety of shopping centers, museums, and entertainment venues. We spent a day exploring the area, visiting the teamLab Borderless digital art museum, and taking a romantic stroll along the waterfront. The island also has a number of restaurants and cafes, making it a great spot for a date night.

Finally, we would be remiss not to mention Tokyo's famous food scene. From sushi to ramen to tempura, there is no shortage of delicious food to try in Tokyo. We particularly enjoyed visiting the Tsukiji Fish Market, where we sampled some of the freshest seafood we've ever had. We also recommend checking out the many izakayas, or Japanese pubs, that can be found throughout the city. These cozy establishments offer a wide variety of small plates and drinks, making them the perfect spot for a romantic evening out.

In conclusion, Tokyo is a city that has something for everyone, and we highly recommend it as a destination for couples. Whether you're interested in history, culture, food, or adventure, you're sure to find something to love in this vibrant metropolis. We can't wait to return and explore even more of what Tokyo has to offer!
