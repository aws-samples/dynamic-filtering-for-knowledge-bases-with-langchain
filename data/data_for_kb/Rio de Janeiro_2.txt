As a couple in our mid-thirties, we recently had the pleasure of visiting Rio de Janeiro and were absolutely blown away by the city's beauty, culture, and energy. Here are some of our favorite attractions and activities that we would highly recommend to other couples visiting Rio.

First and foremost, you cannot visit Rio without taking a trip up to the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue. The views from the top of Corcovado mountain are simply breathtaking, and the statue itself is an awe-inspiring sight. We recommend taking the train up to the top, which offers stunning views of the city and the surrounding mountains. Once you reach the top, you can explore the area around the statue and take plenty of photos to capture the moment.

Another must-see attraction in Rio is the Sugarloaf Mountain. We took the cable car up to the top and were treated to panoramic views of the city and the bay below. The ride up is quite thrilling, and once you reach the top, you can explore the various hiking trails and take in the stunning scenery. We recommend visiting at sunset, as the views of the city lit up below are truly magical.

For a more relaxed day out, we recommend spending a day at Copacabana Beach. The beach is absolutely stunning, with crystal-clear waters and soft, white sand. We spent the day lounging on the beach, swimming in the ocean, and enjoying a delicious lunch at one of the many beachside restaurants. The beach is also a great place to people-watch, as it's always bustling with activity.

If you're looking for a more cultural experience, we recommend visiting the Selaron Steps in the Lapa neighborhood. These colorful steps were created by Chilean artist Jorge Selaron and are covered in tiles from all over the world. The steps are a popular spot for taking photos, and there are plenty of nearby bars and restaurants where you can grab a drink and soak up the local atmosphere.

Finally, we recommend taking a day trip to the Tijuca National Park. The park is home to the largest urban forest in the world and offers plenty of opportunities for hiking, biking, and wildlife spotting. We took a guided tour of the park and were able to see some of the local wildlife, including monkeys, birds, and even a sloth! The park is also home to the famous Pedra da Gavea, a large rock formation that offers stunning views of the city.

In conclusion, Rio de Janeiro is an incredible destination for couples looking for a mix of adventure, culture, and relaxation. We highly recommend visiting the Christ the Redeemer statue, Sugarloaf Mountain, Copacabana Beach, the Selaron Steps, and the Tijuca National Park. With so much to see and do, you're sure to have an unforgettable trip!
