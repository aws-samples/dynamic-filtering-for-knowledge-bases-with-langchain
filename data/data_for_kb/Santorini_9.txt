As a 25-year-old solo traveler, I recently visited Santorini, Greece, and I'm here to share my top recommendations for other solo travelers. Santorini is a beautiful island with stunning views, delicious food, and plenty of activities to keep you busy. Here are my top four recommendations:

First, I highly recommend visiting Oia, a picturesque village located on the northern tip of the island. Oia is famous for its stunning sunsets, and it's the perfect place to wander around and explore the narrow streets and whitewashed buildings. I spent an afternoon walking through the village, stopping to take photos and admire the views. I also recommend visiting the castle ruins, which offer panoramic views of the island and the sea.

Another must-visit attraction is the Red Beach. The beach is located near Akrotiri and is famous for its red sand and cliffs. It's a bit of a hike to get there, but the views are worth it. I spent a few hours lounging on the beach, swimming in the crystal-clear water, and exploring the nearby caves.

If you're interested in history, I recommend visiting the ancient city of Akrotiri. The city was destroyed by a volcanic eruption in the 17th century BC and was buried under ash and pumice for thousands of years. It was rediscovered in the 1960s and has since been excavated, revealing a well-preserved ancient city. I spent a few hours walking through the ruins, admiring the pottery, frescoes, and other artifacts that have been uncovered.

Finally, I recommend taking a boat tour of the caldera. The caldera is the volcanic crater that formed when the island's volcano erupted thousands of years ago. It's now filled with water and is home to several small islands and hot springs. I took a boat tour that stopped at the hot springs, where I swam in the warm, mineral-rich water. The tour also included stops at the islands of Thirassia and Nea Kameni, where I hiked up to the volcano's crater and admired the views.

In conclusion, Santorini is a fantastic destination for solo travelers. There's plenty to see and do, and the island's beauty and charm are sure to leave a lasting impression. I highly recommend visiting Oia, the Red Beach, Akrotiri, and taking a boat tour of the caldera. With so many options, you're sure to have an unforgettable trip!
