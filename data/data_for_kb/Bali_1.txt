As a couple in our early thirties, we recently had the pleasure of visiting Bali for the first time and were absolutely blown away by the beauty and culture of this incredible island. From the stunning beaches to the lush rice terraces, there is no shortage of things to see and do in Bali, and we highly recommend it as a destination for couples looking for a romantic getaway. Here are our top five picks for things to do in Bali:

1. Visit the Tegalalang Rice Terraces: These terraced rice fields are located just north of Ubud and offer breathtaking views of the surrounding countryside. We spent a morning wandering through the terraces, taking in the sights and sounds of the local farmers at work. It was a peaceful and serene experience, and we highly recommend it for couples looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the city.

2. Take a cooking class: Balinese cuisine is known for its fresh ingredients and bold flavors, and we had a blast learning how to make some of our favorite dishes in a traditional Balinese cooking class. Our instructor was knowledgeable and friendly, and we left with a newfound appreciation for the art of Balinese cooking.

3. Relax on the beaches of Seminyak: Seminyak is known for its beautiful beaches, and we spent many lazy afternoons lounging on the sand and taking in the stunning views of the Indian Ocean. The beaches here are perfect for couples looking to relax and unwind, and there are plenty of beachside cafes and bars to keep you entertained.

4. Explore the Ubud Monkey Forest: This lush forest is home to hundreds of monkeys, and we had a blast watching them play and interact with each other. The forest is also home to several ancient temples, which are well worth exploring. Just be sure to keep a close eye on your belongings, as the monkeys are known to be mischievous!

5. Go on a sunrise hike up Mount Batur: This was definitely the highlight of our trip. We woke up at 2 am to make the trek up the volcano, and were rewarded with stunning views of the sunrise over the surrounding countryside. The hike itself is not too difficult, but it can be a bit challenging in the dark, so be sure to bring a headlamp and wear sturdy shoes.

Overall, we had an amazing time in Bali and would highly recommend it as a destination for couples looking for a romantic getaway. There is so much to see and do on this beautiful island, and we can't wait to go back and explore more of what it has to offer.
