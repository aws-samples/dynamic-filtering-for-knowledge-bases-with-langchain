As a 35-year-old mother of two, I recently visited Reykjavik with my family, and we had a fantastic time. The city is full of fun things to do for families with children, and we were never bored during our stay. Here are some of our favorite attractions and activities:

The Blue Lagoon is a must-visit attraction in Iceland, and it's perfect for families with children. The geothermal spa is located in a lava field and features warm, mineral-rich water that is said to have healing properties. My kids loved playing in the water and covering themselves in the silica mud masks. The lagoon also has a restaurant and a bar, so you can grab a bite to eat or a drink while you relax in the water.

Another great attraction for families is the Reykjavik Zoo and Family Park. The zoo is home to a variety of animals, including reindeer, polar bears, and seals. My kids loved feeding the animals and watching the seal show. The park also has a playground, a petting zoo, and a mini-golf course, so there's plenty to keep the kids entertained.

If you're looking for a fun and educational activity, I recommend visiting the Saga Museum. The museum tells the story of Iceland's history and culture through interactive exhibits and displays. My kids loved trying on Viking costumes and learning about the country's past.

For a unique and memorable experience, I suggest taking a whale watching tour. We went on a tour with a company called Elding, and we saw several humpback whales up close. The tour guides were knowledgeable and friendly, and they made sure that everyone on the boat had a great time.

Finally, no trip to Reykjavik would be complete without visiting the Hallgrimskirkja Church. The church is an iconic landmark in the city and offers stunning views of Reykjavik from its tower. My kids loved climbing the tower and looking out over the city.

Overall, we had a fantastic time in Reykjavik and would highly recommend it as a family-friendly destination. There are plenty of fun things to do for families with children, and the city is safe and welcoming. We can't wait to go back and explore more of what Iceland has to offer.
