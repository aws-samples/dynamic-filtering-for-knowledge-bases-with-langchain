As a 35-year-old who loves to travel with my pets, I recently had the opportunity to visit Bali and explore some of its popular tourist attractions that are pet-friendly. Here are some of my top recommendations for anyone looking to travel with their furry friends in Bali.

First on my list is the Bali Bird Park, which is a must-visit for any animal lover. The park is home to over 1,000 birds from 250 different species, and it's a great place to spend a day with your pets. The park has plenty of shaded areas and benches where you can sit and relax with your pets, and there are even some pet-friendly restaurants where you can grab a bite to eat. The staff at the park were very friendly and accommodating, and they made sure that my pets were comfortable and safe at all times.

Next up is the Bali Zoo, which is another great option for pet owners. The zoo has a range of animals, including tigers, elephants, and monkeys, and it's a great place to spend a day with your pets. The zoo has a petting zoo where you can interact with some of the animals, and there are plenty of shaded areas where you can rest and relax with your pets. The staff at the zoo were very friendly and helpful, and they made sure that my pets were well taken care of during our visit.

If you're looking for a more relaxed day out with your pets, then I recommend visiting the Ubud Monkey Forest. The forest is home to over 700 monkeys, and it's a great place to take your pets for a walk. The forest has plenty of shaded areas and walking paths, and it's a great place to escape the heat and enjoy some time in nature with your pets. The staff at the forest were very friendly and helpful, and they made sure that my pets were safe and comfortable during our visit.

Finally, I recommend visiting the Tegalalang Rice Terrace, which is a beautiful rice field located in the north of Bali. The rice terrace is a great place to take your pets for a walk, and it offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside. The rice terrace has plenty of shaded areas and walking paths, and it's a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and enjoy some time in nature with your pets.
