As a 35-year-old traveling with my two dogs, I found Paris to be a pet-friendly city with plenty of attractions and activities for pet owners. Here are some of my top recommendations for traveling with pets in Paris:

The Jardin des Tuileries is a beautiful park located between the Louvre Museum and the Place de la Concorde. It's a great place to take your pets for a walk, with plenty of open space and greenery. The park also has a few cafes where you can grab a coffee or a snack while your pets rest.

Another great option for pet owners is the Bois de Boulogne, a large park on the western edge of the city. The park has plenty of walking trails, lakes, and gardens, making it a perfect place to spend a day with your pets. There are also several pet-friendly cafes and restaurants in the park, where you can grab a bite to eat while your pets relax.

If you're looking for a more active day out with your pets, consider renting a boat on the Seine River. There are several companies that offer pet-friendly boat rentals, allowing you to explore the city from a different perspective while your pets enjoy the fresh air.

For a more cultural experience, consider visiting the Louvre Museum. The museum allows pets on leashes in the outdoor areas, including the famous pyramid and the Tuileries Gardens. It's a great opportunity to see some of the world's most famous art while your pets enjoy the fresh air.

Finally, if you're looking for a unique experience, consider visiting the Montmartre neighborhood. The area is known for its bohemian vibe and artists, and there are plenty of pet-friendly cafes and restaurants where you can grab a bite to eat while your pets rest. The Sacre-Coeur Basilica is also located in Montmartre, and while pets are not allowed inside the church, the outdoor areas offer stunning views of the city.

Overall, Paris is a great destination for pet owners, with plenty of attractions and activities to enjoy with your furry friends. Just be sure to check the rules and regulations of each attraction before you go, and always clean up after your pets.
