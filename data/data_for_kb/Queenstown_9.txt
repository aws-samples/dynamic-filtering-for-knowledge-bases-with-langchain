Hi, I'm John, a 35-year-old father of two. We recently visited Queenstown, New Zealand, and had a fantastic time. I'd like to share some of our favorite family-friendly attractions and activities with you.

First on our list was the Skyline Gondola and Luge. The gondola ride to the top of Bob's Peak was breathtaking, and the views of Queenstown and Lake Wakatipu were stunning. Once at the top, we had a blast racing each other on the luge tracks. There are two tracks, one for beginners and one for more experienced riders, so everyone can enjoy the thrill of the ride.

Next, we visited the Queenstown Gardens. This beautiful park is perfect for a family picnic or a leisurely stroll. There are plenty of open spaces for kids to run around, and the lakefront is a great spot to watch the boats come and go. We also enjoyed the Queenstown Gardens Disc Golf course, which is a fun and challenging way to spend an afternoon.

Another must-visit attraction is the Shotover Jet. This high-speed boat ride takes you through the Shotover River Canyons at speeds of up to 85 kilometers per hour. It's a thrilling experience that the whole family will enjoy. The guides are knowledgeable and entertaining, and they make sure everyone is safe and having a good time.

Finally, we visited the Queenstown Hill Time Walk. This is a moderate hike that takes you to the top of Queenstown Hill, where you can enjoy panoramic views of the surrounding mountains and lakes. The hike takes about two hours round trip, and there are plenty of spots along the way to stop and take in the scenery. We brought a picnic lunch and enjoyed it at the summit while taking in the views.

In conclusion, Queenstown is a fantastic destination for families with children. There are plenty of activities and attractions to keep everyone entertained, and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking. We highly recommend visiting the Skyline Gondola and Luge, the Queenstown Gardens, the Shotover Jet, and the Queenstown Hill Time Walk. We can't wait to come back and explore more of this beautiful city.
