As a family of four with two children aged 10 and 12, we recently visited Barcelona and had a fantastic time exploring the city's many attractions. Here are our top recommendations for families visiting Barcelona.

First on our list is Park Guell, a whimsical park designed by Antoni Gaudi. The park is filled with colorful mosaics, winding paths, and stunning views of the city. Our kids loved exploring the park's many nooks and crannies, and we all enjoyed the stunning views from the park's terrace. The park is also home to a number of sculptures and other artwork, making it a great place to introduce children to art and architecture.

Next, we visited the Barcelona Aquarium, which is located in the Port Vell area of the city. The aquarium is home to over 11,000 marine animals, including sharks, rays, and sea turtles. Our kids were fascinated by the many different species of fish and other marine life, and we all enjoyed the aquarium's interactive exhibits, such as the touch pool where we could touch starfish and other sea creatures. The aquarium also offers a number of educational programs and activities for children, making it a great place to learn about marine life.

We also spent a day at the Barcelona Zoo, which is located in the city's Parc de la Ciutadella. The zoo is home to over 4,000 animals, including lions, tigers, elephants, and giraffes. Our kids loved seeing all of the different animals, and we all enjoyed the zoo's many exhibits, such as the reptile house and the bird aviary. The zoo also offers a number of educational programs and activities for children, making it a great place to learn about wildlife and conservation.

Another highlight of our trip was a visit to the Sagrada Familia, Gaudi's iconic unfinished cathedral. The cathedral is a must-see for anyone visiting Barcelona, and our kids were fascinated by its unique design and intricate details. We all enjoyed exploring the cathedral's many levels and taking in the stunning views from its towers. The cathedral also offers a number of educational programs and activities for children, making it a great place to learn about architecture and history.

Finally, we spent a day at the beach, which is just a short metro ride from the city center. Barcelona's beaches are beautiful and offer a great opportunity to relax and enjoy the sun and the sea. Our kids loved playing in the sand and swimming in the ocean, and we all enjoyed the many beachside cafes and restaurants. The beach is also a great place to people-watch and take in the city's vibrant atmosphere.

In conclusion, Barcelona is a fantastic destination for families, with a wide range of attractions and activities to suit all ages and interests. We highly recommend visiting Park Guell, the Barcelona Aquarium, the Barcelona Zoo, the Sagrada Familia, and the beach. With so much to see and do, Barcelona is sure to be a hit with the whole family!
