As a 35-year-old mother of two, I recently had the pleasure of visiting Bangkok with my family, and we had an amazing time exploring the city's many attractions. Here are some of our favorite things to do in Bangkok with kids:

First, we visited the Grand Palace, which is a must-see attraction in Bangkok. The palace is a stunning example of Thai architecture, with intricate details and beautiful gardens. Our kids loved exploring the grounds and learning about the history of the palace. We also visited Wat Phra Kaew, which is located within the palace complex and is home to the famous Emerald Buddha.

Next, we took a boat ride along the Chao Phraya River, which is a great way to see the city from a different perspective. Our kids loved the boat ride and enjoyed watching the boats and barges passing by. We also stopped at Wat Arun, which is a beautiful temple located on the riverbank. The temple is known for its towering spires and intricate carvings, and our kids were fascinated by its beauty.

Another highlight of our trip was visiting the Bangkok National Museum, which is the largest museum in Southeast Asia. The museum has an extensive collection of Thai art and artifacts, and our kids loved exploring the different exhibits. We also visited the Children's Discovery Museum, which is a great place for kids to learn and have fun. The museum has interactive exhibits on science, art, and culture, and our kids spent hours exploring and playing.

Finally, we visited the Siam Ocean World aquarium, which is a great place to take kids of all ages. The aquarium has a wide variety of marine life, including sharks, stingrays, and sea turtles. Our kids loved watching the fish swim around and learning about the different species. We also visited the Bangkok Butterfly Garden and Insectarium, which is a beautiful garden filled with butterflies and insects. Our kids loved watching the butterflies flit around and learning about the different species.

Overall, we had a fantastic time in Bangkok and would highly recommend it as a family-friendly destination. There are so many things to see and do in the city, and our kids loved every minute of it. We can't wait to go back and explore more of what Bangkok has to offer!
