As a 35-year-old traveler with two small dogs, I recently visited Marrakech and was pleasantly surprised by the number of pet-friendly attractions and activities available. Here are some of my top recommendations for anyone traveling with pets in Marrakech:

First, I would recommend taking a stroll through the Jardin Majorelle. This beautiful garden, designed by French painter Jacques Majorelle, is a peaceful oasis in the middle of the bustling city. The garden is home to a variety of plants and trees, as well as a small museum dedicated to Majorelle's work. While pets are not allowed inside the museum, they are welcome to explore the gardens with you. The garden is well-maintained, and there are plenty of shaded areas for your pets to rest.

Next, I would suggest visiting the Bahia Palace. This stunning palace, built in the late 19th century, is a great example of Moroccan architecture and design. While pets are not allowed inside the palace, they are welcome to explore the gardens with you. The gardens are large and well-maintained, with plenty of space for your pets to run and play.

If you're looking for a more active adventure, consider taking a hike in the Atlas Mountains. There are a number of guided tours available that cater to pet owners, and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking. Just be sure to bring plenty of water and snacks for both you and your pets, as the hike can be quite strenuous.

Finally, I would recommend visiting the Jemaa el-Fnaa, the main square in Marrakech. While pets are not allowed in the square itself, there are plenty of pet-friendly cafes and restaurants nearby where you can grab a bite to eat. The square is a lively and vibrant place, with street performers, vendors, and plenty of people-watching opportunities.

In conclusion, Marrakech is a great destination for pet owners who are looking for a mix of culture, history, and outdoor adventure. With plenty of pet-friendly attractions and activities to choose from, you and your furry friends are sure to have a great time. Just be sure to bring plenty of water and snacks, and always follow local pet regulations to ensure a safe and enjoyable trip.
