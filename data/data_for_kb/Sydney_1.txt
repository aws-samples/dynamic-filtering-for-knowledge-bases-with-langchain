As a 35-year-old mother of two young children, I recently visited Sydney with my family and had an amazing time. We spent a week exploring the city and found plenty of fun things to do with kids. Here are my top recommendations for families visiting Sydney:

1. Taronga Zoo: This zoo is a must-visit for families with kids. It's located on a hill overlooking Sydney Harbor and has a variety of animals, including kangaroos, koalas, and tigers. The zoo also has a great playground and a cable car ride that offers stunning views of the city. We spent a whole day at the zoo and still didn't get to see everything.

2. Sydney Opera House: This iconic building is a must-see for anyone visiting Sydney. We took a guided tour of the building, which was fascinating and informative. Our kids loved the interactive exhibits and the opportunity to learn about the history and architecture of the building. We also attended a children's show at the opera house, which was a lot of fun.

3. Bondi Beach: We spent a day at Bondi Beach, which is a short drive from the city center. The beach is beautiful and has plenty of space for kids to run around and play. We rented surfboards and took a surfing lesson, which was a lot of fun. There are also plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby, so we had a great lunch overlooking the beach.

4. Sydney Harbour Bridge: We walked across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which was a great way to see the city from a different perspective. The bridge has a dedicated pedestrian walkway, and the views of the harbor and the city skyline are stunning. We also took a tour of the bridge, which was fascinating and informative. Our kids loved the opportunity to climb up to the top of the bridge and see the city from above.

5. Darling Harbour: Darling Harbour is a great place for families with kids. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes, as well as a variety of attractions, including the Sea Life Sydney Aquarium and the Wild Life Sydney Zoo. We spent a whole day exploring the area and had a great time. Our kids loved the opportunity to see all of the different animals and learn about them.

Overall, we had a fantastic time in Sydney and would highly recommend it to families with kids. There are plenty of fun things to do and see, and the city is very family-friendly. We can't wait to go back and explore more of what Sydney has to offer!
