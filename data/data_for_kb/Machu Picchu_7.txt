As a 55-year-old pet owner, I recently visited Machu Picchu with my furry friend, and I must say, it was an unforgettable experience! While some may think traveling with pets can be challenging, I found that there are plenty of pet-friendly activities and attractions to enjoy in this beautiful city. Here are my top 5 recommendations for pet-friendly things to do in Machu Picchu:

1. Take a scenic hike with your pet: Machu Picchu is surrounded by stunning landscapes, and there are plenty of hiking trails to explore with your furry friend. One of my favorites is the Inca Trail, which offers breathtaking views of the Andes Mountains and the city below. Just make sure to bring plenty of water and snacks for both you and your pet, and to keep an eye out for any potential hazards along the trail.

2. Visit the Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge: This luxurious hotel is located right at the entrance to Machu Picchu and offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains. While pets are not allowed inside the hotel, they are welcome to stay in the outdoor seating area, where you can enjoy a delicious meal or a refreshing drink while taking in the scenery. The staff were very friendly and accommodating to my pet, and even provided a bowl of water and some treats.

3. Explore the Sacred Valley: The Sacred Valley is a beautiful region located just outside of Machu Picchu, and it's a great place to explore with your pet. There are plenty of pet-friendly hiking trails, as well as local markets and villages to visit. Just make sure to keep your pet on a leash and to clean up after them, as the area is home to many wild animals and delicate ecosystems.

4. Visit the Machu Picchu Museum: This museum is located in the nearby town of Aguas Calientes and offers a fascinating look at the history and culture of the Incas. While pets are not allowed inside the museum, they are welcome to stay outside in the courtyard, where you can enjoy a peaceful picnic lunch or a cup of coffee while taking in the views. The museum staff were very friendly and accommodating to my pet, and even offered to watch him while I explored the exhibits.

5. Take a scenic train ride: The train ride to Machu Picchu is one of the most beautiful and scenic journeys in the world, and it's a great way to experience the stunning landscapes of Peru. While pets are not allowed on the train, there are plenty of pet-friendly transportation options available, such as private cars or buses. Just make sure to book in advance and to bring plenty of food, water, and supplies for your pet.

Overall, I highly recommend visiting Machu Picchu with your pet. While there are some restrictions and challenges to traveling with pets, there are also plenty of opportunities to enjoy this beautiful city and its surroundings with your furry friend by your side. Just make sure to plan ahead, be respectful of local customs and regulations, and to always keep your pet safe and comfortable.
