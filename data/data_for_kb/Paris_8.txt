I am a 35-year-old mother of two and have been to Paris with my family. Here are some of the most popular tourist attractions and fun things to do in Paris for families with children.

The Eiffel Tower is a must-visit attraction in Paris. It is an iconic landmark that offers stunning views of the city. My kids were in awe of the tower's size and beauty. We took the elevator to the top and enjoyed the panoramic views of Paris. We also had lunch at the restaurant on the second floor, which was a unique experience.

Another popular attraction is the Louvre Museum. It is the world's largest art museum and home to the famous Mona Lisa painting. My kids were fascinated by the Egyptian mummies and the Greek and Roman sculptures. We also took a guided tour of the museum, which was very informative and engaging for the kids.

The Notre Dame Cathedral is another must-visit attraction in Paris. It is a beautiful Gothic cathedral that is over 800 years old. My kids were amazed by the cathedral's size and architecture. We also climbed to the top of the cathedral's towers, which offered stunning views of the city.

If you're looking for a fun and educational experience, the Science Museum is a great option. It has interactive exhibits that teach kids about science, technology, and engineering. My kids loved the space exhibit, where they could see real spacecraft and learn about space exploration.

For a more relaxed and fun experience, you can take a boat tour along the Seine River. It offers a unique perspective of Paris and its landmarks. My kids loved seeing the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame Cathedral, and other famous landmarks from the water.

Paris is a city that offers something for everyone, including families with children. With so many attractions and activities to choose from, you're sure to have a memorable and enjoyable trip.
