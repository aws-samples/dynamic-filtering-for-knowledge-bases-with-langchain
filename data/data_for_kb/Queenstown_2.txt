As a 35-year-old solo traveler, I recently visited Queenstown, New Zealand, and I can honestly say that it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. The city is nestled in the Southern Alps and surrounded by breathtaking landscapes, making it the perfect destination for outdoor enthusiasts. Here are some of my top recommendations for things to do in Queenstown as a solo traveler.

First, I recommend taking a scenic flight over Milford Sound. The flight takes you over some of the most stunning landscapes in the world, including snow-capped mountains, glaciers, and fjords. The views are absolutely breathtaking, and the experience is even more incredible when you're flying solo. You can sit by the window and take in the views without having to share the experience with anyone else.

Next, I recommend taking a hike up Ben Lomond. The hike is challenging, but the views from the top are worth every step. The trail takes you through lush forests and past stunning waterfalls, and the summit offers panoramic views of Queenstown and the surrounding mountains. It's a great way to get some exercise and enjoy the beautiful scenery.

Another must-do activity in Queenstown is bungee jumping. The city is home to the world's first commercial bungee jumping site, and there are several locations where you can take the plunge. I recommend doing it solo, as it's an incredibly empowering experience to face your fears and jump off a bridge all by yourself. The views from the bungee jumping site are also incredible, as you can see the entire city and the surrounding mountains.

If you're looking for a more relaxing activity, I recommend taking a boat tour on Lake Wakatipu. The lake is stunning, and the boat tour takes you past some of the most beautiful scenery in the area. You can sit back and relax while taking in the views, or you can get out and explore some of the nearby hiking trails. The boat tour is a great way to unwind after a day of adventure.

Finally, I recommend checking out the local food and wine scene. Queenstown is known for its delicious cuisine and world-class wines, and there are plenty of restaurants and wineries to choose from. I recommend trying some of the local specialties, such as lamb, seafood, and cheese. There are also several wine tours available, which are a great way to sample some of the best wines in the region.

Overall, I highly recommend visiting Queenstown as a solo traveler. The city has so much to offer, from breathtaking landscapes to thrilling adventures to delicious food and wine. Whether you're looking for a relaxing getaway or an action-packed adventure, Queenstown has something for everyone.
