As a 35-year-old family man, I recently had the pleasure of visiting Rome with my wife and two young children. We had an amazing time exploring the city and experiencing all it had to offer. Here are some of the highlights of our trip:

The Colosseum: This iconic landmark is a must-visit for any family traveling to Rome. Our kids were fascinated by the history of the amphitheater and loved learning about the gladiators and the games that were held there. The Colosseum is massive, and there is so much to see and explore. We spent a few hours walking around and taking in the sights.

The Roman Forum: Located right next to the Colosseum, the Roman Forum is another must-visit attraction. This ancient city center is home to a number of well-preserved ruins, including temples, government buildings, and marketplaces. Our kids loved running around and exploring the different ruins, and we all learned a lot about ancient Roman history.

The Vatican Museums: While the Vatican Museums may not seem like the most kid-friendly attraction, our children actually really enjoyed it. They loved seeing all of the different art and artifacts, and the Sistine Chapel was a highlight for all of us. We spent a few hours wandering through the museums and admiring the incredible works of art.

The Trevi Fountain: This beautiful fountain is a must-see for any family visiting Rome. Our kids loved throwing coins into the fountain and making a wish. The fountain is located in a lively square, and there are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby where you can grab a bite to eat.

The Spanish Steps: These iconic steps are a great place to relax and take in the sights of Rome. Our kids loved climbing up and down the steps and taking in the views of the city. The steps are located in a trendy neighborhood, and there are plenty of shops and cafes nearby where you can grab a snack or a drink.

Overall, we had an amazing time in Rome and would highly recommend it as a family-friendly destination. There is so much to see and do in this incredible city, and our kids loved every minute of it.
