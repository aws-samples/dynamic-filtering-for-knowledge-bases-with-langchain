As a 35-year-old mother of two, I recently visited Santorini with my family, and we had an amazing time! The island is beautiful, and there are plenty of fun things to do for families. Here are some of our favorite attractions and activities:

One of the highlights of our trip was visiting the Red Beach. The beach is located near Akrotiri and is known for its stunning red sand and cliffs. The water was crystal clear and perfect for swimming, and there were plenty of sunbeds and umbrellas available for rent. We also enjoyed exploring the nearby ruins of the ancient city of Akrotiri, which was buried by a volcanic eruption in the 17th century BC.

Another must-see attraction in Santorini is the Oia Sunset. Oia is a picturesque village located on the northern tip of the island, and it's known for its beautiful sunsets. We watched the sunset from a local restaurant, where we enjoyed delicious Greek food and wine while taking in the stunning views.

If you're looking for a fun and educational activity for your family, I highly recommend visiting the Archaeological Museum of Thira. The museum is located in Fira and features a collection of artifacts from the ancient city of Akrotiri. My kids loved seeing the pottery, sculptures, and frescoes, and they learned a lot about the history of the island.

For a unique and exciting experience, we took a boat tour of the caldera. The tour took us around the island, where we saw the famous blue domes of Oia, the black sand beach of Perissa, and the hot springs of Nea Kameni. We also had the opportunity to swim in the hot springs, which were a bit sulfuric but still fun to experience.

Finally, we visited the Ancient Thera site, which is located on the top of a mountain overlooking the island. The site features the ruins of an ancient city, including a theater, a temple, and a marketplace. The views from the top were breathtaking, and it was a great way to learn about the history of the island.

Overall, we had an amazing time in Santorini and would highly recommend it for families looking for a fun and relaxing vacation. There are plenty of activities to keep everyone entertained, and the island's natural beauty is truly breathtaking.
