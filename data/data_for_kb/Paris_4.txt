Paris is a city that never fails to impress, and as a family of four with two young children aged 5 and 7, we had a fantastic time exploring the city's many attractions. Here are some of our top recommendations for families visiting Paris:

The Eiffel Tower is, of course, a must-see attraction, and we were not disappointed. We took the elevator to the top and enjoyed breathtaking views of the city. The kids loved looking out over the rooftops and spotting all the famous landmarks. We also visited the Champ de Mars park nearby, which was a great place for the kids to run around and burn off some energy.

Another highlight of our trip was a visit to the Louvre Museum. We were worried that the kids might get bored, but they were fascinated by the Egyptian mummies and the famous Mona Lisa painting. The museum offers free admission for children under 18, which was a nice bonus. We also took advantage of the museum's family programs, which included guided tours and art workshops for kids.

We spent a day at Disneyland Paris, which was a real treat for the kids. The park is divided into several themed areas, including Main Street USA, Adventureland, and Fantasyland. The kids loved the rides, shows, and parades, and we even got to meet some of their favorite Disney characters. We stayed until the evening to watch the spectacular fireworks display, which was a real highlight of our trip.

For a more educational experience, we visited the Musée d'Orsay, which is home to an impressive collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art. The kids were fascinated by the paintings of Monet, Van Gogh, and Renoir, and we spent hours wandering through the galleries. The museum also offers family programs, including guided tours and art workshops for kids.

Finally, we took a boat tour along the Seine River, which was a great way to see the city from a different perspective. The kids loved seeing the famous landmarks from the water, and we even got to see some of the city's bridges light up at night. We booked a tour with a company that offered a kid-friendly guide, who kept the kids entertained with stories and facts about the city.

In conclusion, Paris is a fantastic destination for families, with plenty of attractions and activities to keep everyone entertained. We highly recommend visiting the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, Disneyland Paris, the Musée d'Orsay, and taking a boat tour along the Seine River. With so much to see and do, you're sure to have a memorable family vacation in the City of Light.
