Hi, I'm Sarah, a 35-year-old mother of two, and I recently visited London with my family. We had a fantastic time exploring the city and discovering all the fun things it has to offer for families. Here are some of our favorite attractions and activities:

The London Eye: This iconic Ferris wheel offers breathtaking views of the city, and it's a must-visit for any family visiting London. The ride lasts about 30 minutes, giving you plenty of time to take in the sights. My kids loved spotting famous landmarks like Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament.

The Tower of London: This historic castle is a great place to learn about London's rich history. We took a guided tour with one of the Yeoman Warders, also known as Beefeaters, who shared fascinating stories about the tower's past. My kids were particularly interested in the Crown Jewels and the ravens that live on the grounds.

The British Museum: This world-famous museum is home to an incredible collection of artifacts from around the world. We spent hours exploring the galleries and learning about ancient civilizations. My kids loved the Egyptian mummies and the Rosetta Stone.

Hyde Park: This massive park is a great place to relax and enjoy some fresh air. We rented bikes and rode around the park, stopping to feed the ducks and play in the playground. My kids also enjoyed the Diana Memorial Playground, which features a huge wooden pirate ship.

Harry Potter Studio Tour: If your family is a fan of the Harry Potter series, you won't want to miss this tour. It takes you behind the scenes of the movies and shows you how the special effects were created. My kids were amazed by the sets and costumes and loved trying out the green screen technology.

Overall, we had a fantastic time in London and would highly recommend it for families. There's so much to see and do, and we can't wait to go back and explore more of this amazing city.
