As a 30-year-old who loves to travel with my pets, I recently visited Bali and was pleasantly surprised by the number of pet-friendly attractions and activities available. Here are my top five recommendations for anyone traveling to Bali with their furry friends.

First on my list is the Bali Bird Park, a beautiful zoo that is home to over 1,000 birds from 250 different species. The park is well-maintained and has plenty of shaded areas to keep your pets cool while you explore. The staff were very friendly and accommodating, and even offered to take photos of me and my pets with some of the birds.

Next up is the Bali Safari and Marine Park, which is a must-visit for any animal lover. The park has a wide variety of animals, including lions, tigers, and elephants, and offers a number of pet-friendly activities, such as a petting zoo and a safari ride. The staff were very knowledgeable and took great care to ensure that both my pets and I had a safe and enjoyable experience.

If you're looking for a more relaxing activity, I recommend visiting the Ubud Monkey Forest. While the monkeys are not allowed to interact with pets, the forest itself is a beautiful and peaceful place to walk around with your furry friends. Just be sure to keep them on a leash and avoid feeding the monkeys, as they can be aggressive if they think you have food.

For a unique and memorable experience, I suggest taking a pet-friendly cooking class at the Balinese Cooking School. The school offers a number of classes that cater to pet owners, and the staff were very accommodating and made sure that my pets were comfortable and well-taken care of while I learned how to cook traditional Balinese dishes.

Finally, I recommend visiting the Tegalalang Rice Terrace, which is a beautiful and scenic spot that is perfect for a leisurely walk with your pets. The terraces are well-maintained and offer stunning views of the surrounding countryside. Just be sure to keep your pets on a leash and avoid walking on the rice paddies, as they can be slippery and dangerous.

In conclusion, Bali is a great destination for anyone traveling with pets. With a wide variety of pet-friendly attractions and activities, there is something for everyone to enjoy. Whether you're looking for a relaxing day at the beach or an exciting adventure in the jungle, Bali has it all. I highly recommend visiting this beautiful island with your furry friends.
