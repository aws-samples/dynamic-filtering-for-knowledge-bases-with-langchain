As a 35-year-old mother of two, I recently visited Dubai with my family and had an amazing time. The city is full of exciting attractions and activities that are perfect for families with children. Here are some of our favorite things to do in Dubai:

The Dubai Mall is a must-visit destination for families with children. It's one of the largest malls in the world and offers a wide range of activities for kids, including an indoor theme park, an ice rink, and a massive aquarium. Our kids loved the Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo, where they got to see sharks, stingrays, and other marine life up close. They also enjoyed the indoor theme park, which features rides, games, and attractions for all ages.

Another highlight of our trip was the Dubai Fountain, which is located right outside the mall. The fountain show is absolutely stunning, with water jets that shoot up to 500 feet in the air and are synchronized to music. Our kids were mesmerized by the show and couldn't stop talking about it.

If you're looking for a more educational experience, I highly recommend visiting the Dubai Museum. The museum offers a fascinating look at the history and culture of Dubai, from its early days as a fishing village to its current status as a global city. Our kids loved learning about the traditional way of life in Dubai and seeing the old houses, mosques, and souks.

For a more adventurous experience, we recommend visiting the Dubai Miracle Garden. The garden is home to over 45 million flowers and features stunning displays and sculptures made entirely of flowers. Our kids loved exploring the garden and taking photos with the colorful displays.

Finally, no trip to Dubai would be complete without a visit to the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking, and our kids loved watching the sunset over the city. We also visited the observation deck on the 124th floor, which offers a 360-degree view of Dubai.

Overall, we had an amazing time in Dubai and would highly recommend it as a family-friendly destination. There are so many fun things to do and see, and our kids loved every minute of it. We can't wait to go back and explore more of this incredible city!
