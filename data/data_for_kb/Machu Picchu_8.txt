As a 68-year-old retiree, I recently had the opportunity to visit Machu Picchu, a place I had dreamed of seeing since I was a child. I was not disappointed. The site is breathtaking, and there are plenty of activities to keep seniors like me entertained and engaged. Here are some of my top recommendations for things to do in Machu Picchu.

First and foremost, I recommend taking a guided tour of the site. Our guide was knowledgeable and engaging, and he helped us understand the history and significance of the site in a way that we never could have on our own. He also helped us navigate the site, which can be challenging for seniors due to its steep inclines and narrow pathways.

Next, I recommend hiking up to the Sun Gate. This hike is not for the faint of heart, but it is well worth the effort. The views from the top are stunning, and it is a great way to get some exercise and fresh air. The hike takes about two hours round trip, and it is not too strenuous. However, I would recommend wearing comfortable shoes and bringing plenty of water.

Another activity I recommend is visiting the Inca Bridge. This is a short hike from the main site, and it offers beautiful views of the surrounding mountains. The bridge itself is not original, but it is still an impressive feat of engineering. It is also a great place to take some photos.

Finally, I recommend taking some time to relax and enjoy the scenery. Machu Picchu is a place of great beauty and tranquility, and it is easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of the tour groups. However, I found that taking some time to sit and appreciate the views was one of the most rewarding parts of the trip. There are plenty of places to sit and relax, and the views are simply stunning.

In conclusion, Machu Picchu is a must-visit destination for seniors who are looking for a unique and unforgettable travel experience. There are plenty of activities to keep you engaged and entertained, and the site itself is breathtaking. I highly recommend taking a guided tour, hiking up to the Sun Gate, visiting the Inca Bridge, and taking some time to relax and enjoy the scenery.
