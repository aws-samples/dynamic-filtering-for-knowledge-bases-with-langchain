As a 65-year-old retiree, I recently visited Rome and had an incredible time. The city is full of history, culture, and delicious food, making it an ideal destination for seniors. Here are some of my top recommendations for things to do in Rome:

The Colosseum: This iconic landmark is a must-see for anyone visiting Rome. As a senior, I appreciated the opportunity to learn about the city's rich history and the engineering marvel that is the Colosseum. The guided tour was informative and engaging, and the views from the top were breathtaking. I would recommend purchasing tickets in advance to avoid long lines.

Vatican City: The Vatican is a must-visit for anyone interested in art, history, or religion. The Vatican Museums are home to some of the world's most famous works of art, including the Sistine Chapel. The museum can be overwhelming, but I found the audio guide to be helpful in navigating the exhibits. The St. Peter's Basilica is also worth a visit, with its stunning architecture and beautiful artwork.

Trevi Fountain: The Trevi Fountain is a must-see for anyone visiting Rome. The fountain is a beautiful example of Baroque architecture and is a popular spot for tourists to toss a coin and make a wish. The area around the fountain can be crowded, but I found that visiting early in the morning or late at night allowed me to enjoy the fountain without the crowds.

Piazza Navona: Piazza Navona is a beautiful square in the heart of Rome, with stunning architecture and a lively atmosphere. The square is home to several fountains, including the famous Fountain of the Four Rivers, and is surrounded by cafes and restaurants. I enjoyed people-watching and sipping on a cappuccino while taking in the sights and sounds of the square.

Trastevere: Trastevere is a charming neighborhood on the west bank of the Tiber River, known for its narrow streets, colorful buildings, and lively atmosphere. The neighborhood is home to many restaurants, cafes, and shops, making it a great place to spend an afternoon exploring. I enjoyed wandering through the streets and taking in the sights and sounds of the neighborhood.

In conclusion, Rome is a fantastic destination for seniors who are interested in history, culture, and delicious food. The city has something for everyone, and I highly recommend visiting the Colosseum, Vatican City, Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona, and Trastevere. Just be sure to wear comfortable shoes and take breaks when needed, as there is a lot of walking involved in exploring this beautiful city.
