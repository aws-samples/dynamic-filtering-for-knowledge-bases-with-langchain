As a family of four, with two kids aged 8 and 10, we recently had the opportunity to visit the beautiful island of Bora Bora. Here are some of the top attractions and activities we recommend for families visiting this stunning destination.

First on our list is the Bora Bora Lagoonarium, a must-visit for families with young children. This marine park offers a chance to get up close and personal with a variety of marine life, including sharks, rays, and tropical fish. We loved snorkeling in the crystal-clear waters and feeding the fish. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly, and they made sure we had a safe and enjoyable experience.

Next, we recommend taking a boat tour of the lagoon. There are many tour companies to choose from, but we went with Lagoon Service Bora Bora, and we were not disappointed. Our guide was informative and entertaining, and we saw some of the most beautiful sights we've ever seen. We stopped at a motu (small island) for a picnic lunch and had the chance to swim and relax on the beach.

If you're looking for a more active adventure, consider taking a 4x4 tour of the island. We went with Bora Bora 4x4 Safari, and we had a blast. Our guide took us to some of the most scenic spots on the island, including Mount Otemanu and the Valley of the Kings. We also visited a local fruit plantation and learned about the island's history and culture.

For families who love water sports, Bora Bora has plenty to offer. We went jet skiing with Bora Jet Ski Tours and had a blast. The staff was friendly and patient, and they made sure we felt comfortable before heading out on the water. We also tried paddleboarding and kayaking, which were both fun and easy for kids of all ages.

Finally, no trip to Bora Bora would be complete without a visit to Matira Beach. This beautiful stretch of white sand is perfect for swimming, sunbathing, and relaxing. We spent a few hours here one afternoon, and it was the perfect way to unwind after a busy day of sightseeing.

In conclusion, Bora Bora is a fantastic destination for families. There are plenty of activities to keep kids of all ages entertained, and the stunning scenery is sure to leave a lasting impression. We highly recommend visiting the Bora Bora Lagoonarium, taking a boat tour of the lagoon, going on a 4x4 tour of the island, trying out some water sports, and spending some time at Matira Beach. We can't wait to go back!
