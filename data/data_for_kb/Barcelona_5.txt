I am 36 years old and I recently visited Barcelona with my family. Here are some of the popular tourist attractions and fun things to do in Barcelona that we enjoyed:

1. Park Guell: This park, designed by Antoni Gaudi, is a must-visit for families. It features colorful mosaics, winding pathways, and stunning views of the city. My kids loved exploring the park and taking pictures with the unique sculptures.

2. Sagrada Familia: Another Gaudi masterpiece, the Sagrada Familia is an iconic landmark in Barcelona. While the interior of the church is still under construction, the exterior is breathtaking. We took a guided tour to learn more about the history and architecture of the church.

3. La Rambla: This bustling street is a great place to experience the energy of Barcelona. It's lined with shops, cafes, and street performers. We enjoyed strolling down the street, people-watching, and trying some of the local cuisine.

4. Barcelona Zoo: If you're traveling with young kids, the Barcelona Zoo is a great option. It's home to over 4,000 animals, including lions, tigers, and elephants. The zoo also has a children's zoo where kids can pet and feed some of the animals.

5. Barceloneta Beach: Barcelona has several beaches, but Barceloneta Beach is one of the most popular. It's easily accessible by public transportation and has plenty of amenities, including restaurants, cafes, and beach clubs. We spent a day lounging on the beach, swimming in the Mediterranean Sea, and enjoying the beautiful weather.

Overall, Barcelona is a great destination for families. There's something for everyone, from art and architecture to beaches and zoos. We had a fantastic time exploring the city and can't wait to go back!
