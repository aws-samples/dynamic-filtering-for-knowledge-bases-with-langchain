As a couple in our early thirties, we recently visited Santorini and were blown away by the beauty and romance of the island. Here are some of our top recommendations for couples visiting Santorini:

1. Oia Sunset: The sunset in Oia is a must-see attraction for any couple visiting Santorini. The town is known for its stunning views of the caldera and the sunset is truly breathtaking. We recommend finding a spot along the caldera to watch the sunset, perhaps with a glass of local wine in hand.

2. Wine Tasting: Santorini is known for its unique and delicious wines, and there are many wineries on the island that offer tastings. We visited the Santo Wines Winery, which has an amazing view of the caldera and offers a variety of wines to taste. It's a great way to spend an afternoon with your partner, learning about the local wines and enjoying the beautiful scenery.

3. Red Beach: The Red Beach is a unique and beautiful beach located near Akrotiri. The sand is red and the water is crystal clear, making it a perfect spot for a romantic picnic or a swim. We recommend renting a car and driving to the beach, as it can be a bit difficult to get to by public transportation.

4. Akrotiri Archaeological Site: The Akrotiri Archaeological Site is a must-see attraction for history buffs. The site is an ancient Minoan city that was buried by a volcanic eruption in the 17th century BC. The site has been well-preserved and offers a fascinating glimpse into the past. We recommend taking a guided tour to learn more about the history of the site and the Minoan civilization.

5. Caldera Cruise: A caldera cruise is a great way to see the beauty of Santorini from a different perspective. There are many companies that offer cruises around the caldera, which include stops at the hot springs, the volcano, and the island of Thirassia. We recommend taking a sunset cruise, as the views of the caldera at sunset are truly magical.

Overall, we highly recommend Santorini as a destination for couples. The island is beautiful, romantic, and offers a variety of activities and attractions to enjoy together. We can't wait to go back and explore more of what Santorini has to offer!
