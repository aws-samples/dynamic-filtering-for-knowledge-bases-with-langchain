As a 35-year-old mother of two young children, I recently had the pleasure of visiting Marrakech with my family. We spent a week exploring the city and its many attractions, and I wanted to share some of our favorite experiences with you.

First on our list was the Jardin Majorelle, a stunning botanical garden created by French painter Jacques Majorelle in the 1920s. The garden is filled with exotic plants, fountains, and pools, and the bright blue buildings and structures are a feast for the eyes. My kids loved exploring the winding paths and discovering all the different plants and flowers. We also visited the Berber Museum, which is located on the grounds of the garden and showcases the rich cultural heritage of the Berber people of North Africa.

Next, we headed to the Medina, the old city of Marrakech. The Medina is a maze of narrow streets and alleyways, filled with shops, markets, and restaurants. We spent hours wandering around, exploring the different souks (markets) and trying out the local street food. My kids loved watching the craftsmen at work, making pottery, jewelry, and other handmade goods. We also visited the Bahia Palace, a beautiful 19th-century palace with stunning tilework and intricate carvings.

Another highlight of our trip was a visit to the Atlas Mountains. We took a day trip to the Ourika Valley, where we went on a hike through the mountains and visited a traditional Berber village. The views were breathtaking, and my kids loved seeing the local animals, such as goats and donkeys. We also stopped at a traditional Berber house, where we learned about the way of life of the Berber people and tried some delicious homemade mint tea.

Finally, we visited the Koutoubia Mosque, the largest mosque in Marrakech and one of the city's most iconic landmarks. The mosque is not open to non-Muslims, but we were able to walk around the grounds and admire the beautiful architecture. The minaret is particularly impressive, standing at over 70 meters tall and adorned with intricate carvings and mosaics.

Overall, we had a fantastic time in Marrakech and would highly recommend it as a family-friendly destination. There is so much to see and do, and the city has a unique and vibrant culture that is sure to captivate both kids and adults alike.
