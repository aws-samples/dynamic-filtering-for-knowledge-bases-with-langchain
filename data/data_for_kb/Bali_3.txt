I'm a 30-year-old who loves to travel with my pets. I recently visited Bali, Indonesia, and I'm excited to share some of the best pet-friendly attractions and activities I found during my trip.

First on my list is the Bali Animal Welfare Association (BAWA). This non-profit organization is dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating animals in need. They have a shelter in Ubud where you can visit and play with the animals, and they also offer volunteer opportunities if you're interested in getting more involved. My pets had a great time playing with the other animals, and it was a great way to support a good cause.

Next up is the Bali Bird Park. This park is home to over 1,000 birds from 250 different species, and they welcome pets on leashes. The park is beautifully landscaped, and there are plenty of shaded areas to rest in. My pets loved watching the birds fly around and listening to their songs.

Another great option for pet owners is the Bali Safari and Marine Park. This park has a petting zoo where you can interact with goats, rabbits, and other small animals. They also have a petting pool where you can swim with the park's resident stingrays. My pets had a blast playing with the other animals and getting up close and personal with the stingrays.

Finally, I recommend checking out the Jimbaran Bay Beach. This beach is known for its beautiful sunsets and delicious seafood. There are plenty of pet-friendly restaurants and cafes where you can enjoy a meal while your pets play in the sand. The beach is also a great place for a leisurely stroll or a game of fetch.

Overall, Bali is a great destination for pet owners. There are plenty of pet-friendly attractions and activities to enjoy, and the locals are very welcoming to pets. I highly recommend checking out BAWA, the Bali Bird Park, the Bali Safari and Marine Park, and Jimbaran Bay Beach if you're traveling with pets.
