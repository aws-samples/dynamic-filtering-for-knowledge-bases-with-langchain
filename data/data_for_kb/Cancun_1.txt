The park has several pet-friendly areas, including a beach where you can swim with your pet and a pet-friendly restaurant. There are also plenty of activities to enjoy, such as snorkeling, swimming with dolphins, and exploring ancient ruins.

4. Punta Nizuc: This area is located just south of Cancun and is a great spot for pet owners who want to get away from the crowds. The area has several pet-friendly beaches, as well as a nature reserve where you can go hiking with your pet.
