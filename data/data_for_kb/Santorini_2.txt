As a couple in our early thirties, we recently had the pleasure of visiting the stunning island of Santorini. With its iconic blue-domed churches, breathtaking caldera views, and romantic ambiance, Santorini is a perfect destination for couples looking for a dreamy getaway. Here are some of our top recommendations for things to do and see during your visit:

First on our list is a sunset catamaran cruise. We booked a tour with a local company that took us around the caldera, stopping at the famous Red Beach and hot springs. The views of the island from the water were absolutely breathtaking, and watching the sunset over the Aegean Sea was a truly magical experience. We also had the opportunity to swim in the crystal-clear waters and enjoy a delicious meal on board.

Next, we recommend visiting the ancient city of Akrotiri. This well-preserved archaeological site is often referred to as the "Minoan Pompeii" and offers a fascinating glimpse into the past. We were amazed by the intricate frescoes and advanced infrastructure of the city, which was buried by a volcanic eruption around 1600 BC.

For a unique dining experience, we suggest checking out the cliffside restaurant, Selene. The food was exceptional, with a focus on fresh, locally-sourced ingredients and traditional Greek cuisine. The views of the caldera from the restaurant were stunning, and the service was impeccable.

If you're looking for a romantic activity, we highly recommend taking a donkey ride up the steep steps from the port to the town of Fira. While it may be a bit of a workout, the views from the top are worth it. Plus, it's a fun and unique way to experience the island's charm.

Finally, we recommend taking a stroll through the charming town of Oia. Known for its picturesque streets, blue-domed churches, and stunning caldera views, Oia is a must-visit for any couple traveling to Santorini. We spent hours wandering through the town, taking photos, and enjoying the laid-back atmosphere.

Overall, we had an amazing time in Santorini and would highly recommend it to any couple looking for a romantic getaway. With its stunning scenery, rich history, and delicious food, there's something for everyone on this beautiful island.
