As a couple in our late twenties, we recently had the opportunity to visit Machu Picchu, and we were absolutely blown away by the beauty and history of this incredible place. Here are some of our favorite attractions and activities that we would recommend to any couple visiting Machu Picchu:

First and foremost, we highly recommend taking a guided tour of the Machu Picchu ruins. Our guide was incredibly knowledgeable and helped us to understand the history and significance of each structure we saw. We learned about the Incan civilization and their advanced engineering techniques, as well as the various theories about why Machu Picchu was built and how it was used. The ruins themselves are absolutely breathtaking, and we spent hours exploring the different terraces, temples, and other structures.

Another must-do activity for couples is hiking up Huayna Picchu, the mountain that looms over the ruins. The hike is challenging, but the views from the top are absolutely worth it. We felt like we were on top of the world as we looked out over the lush green valleys and towering mountains that surround Machu Picchu. The hike also offers a unique perspective on the ruins themselves, as you can see the entire complex from above.

For a more relaxed activity, we recommend taking a scenic train ride to Aguas Calientes, the town at the base of Machu Picchu. The train ride offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside, and Aguas Calientes itself is a charming little town with plenty of restaurants and shops to explore. We enjoyed strolling through the town and sampling some of the local cuisine, including delicious Peruvian dishes like ceviche and lomo saltado.

Finally, we recommend taking some time to simply relax and soak in the beauty of Machu Picchu. We spent a lot of time just sitting on the terraces and taking in the views, and it was truly a magical experience. We also enjoyed exploring the surrounding area, including the nearby Inca Bridge and the Sun Gate, which offers a stunning view of the ruins as you approach from the Inca Trail.

Overall, we had an incredible time in Machu Picchu and would highly recommend it to any couple looking for a unique and unforgettable travel experience. The beauty and history of this place are truly awe-inspiring, and we feel incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to visit.
