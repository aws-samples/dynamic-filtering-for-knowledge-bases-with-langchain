As a couple in our early thirties, we recently had the pleasure of visiting Tokyo for the first time. We were blown away by the city's vibrant energy, rich culture, and endless entertainment options. Here are some of our top recommendations for couples visiting Tokyo:

First on our list is the Meiji Shrine. This beautiful Shinto shrine is nestled in a peaceful forest, providing a serene escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. We loved walking through the tranquil gardens and watching the traditional Shinto wedding ceremonies taking place. The shrine is also a popular spot for couples to get their fortunes told, and we had fun reading ours together.

Next, we recommend visiting the Senso-ji Temple in Asakusa. This ancient temple is one of Tokyo's most famous landmarks and is a must-visit for any couple looking to immerse themselves in Japanese culture. We loved strolling through the bustling Nakamise shopping street, which is lined with traditional Japanese shops selling everything from souvenirs to sweets. We also enjoyed watching the traditional Japanese street performers and trying our hand at calligraphy.

For a more modern experience, we suggest visiting the Tokyo Skytree. This towering structure offers breathtaking views of the city, and we loved watching the sunset from the observation deck. The Skytree also has a number of restaurants and shops, making it a great spot for a romantic dinner or a fun night out.

If you're looking for a unique dining experience, we recommend checking out one of Tokyo's many themed restaurants. We had a blast at the Robot Restaurant, where we were treated to a wild show of neon lights, robots, and scantily-clad dancers. It was definitely a memorable experience!

Finally, we suggest taking a stroll through the beautiful Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden. This sprawling park is the perfect place to relax and unwind, and we loved exploring the various gardens and ponds. The park is also a popular spot for cherry blossom viewing in the spring, making it a great spot for couples to take a romantic stroll.

Overall, we had an amazing time in Tokyo and would highly recommend it to any couple looking for a fun and romantic getaway. With so much to see and do, you're sure to create memories that will last a lifetime.
