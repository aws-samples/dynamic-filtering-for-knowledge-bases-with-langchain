As a family with two young children, aged 5 and 7, we recently visited Queenstown and had an amazing time. Here are some of our favorite attractions and activities that we would highly recommend for families with children:

1. Skyline Gondola and Luge: The Skyline Gondola is a must-visit attraction in Queenstown. It offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains and Lake Wakatipu. Once you reach the top, you can enjoy a range of activities, including the Luge, which is a fun and exciting ride down the mountainside. Our kids loved the Luge and we ended up going on it multiple times.

2. Queenstown Gardens: The Queenstown Gardens are a beautiful and peaceful place to spend an afternoon. There are plenty of walking trails, picnic areas, and playgrounds for kids to enjoy. Our kids loved exploring the gardens and playing on the swings and slides.

3. Walter Peak High Country Farm: Walter Peak High Country Farm is a great place to learn about farming and rural life in New Zealand. You can take a scenic boat ride across Lake Wakatipu to get to the farm, where you can enjoy a farm tour, watch sheep shearing, and even have a BBQ lunch. Our kids loved feeding the animals and learning about the different types of farm equipment.

4. Queenstown Hill: Queenstown Hill is a great place to go for a hike and enjoy some stunning views of Queenstown and the surrounding mountains. The hike is relatively easy and takes about 2-3 hours round trip. Our kids loved the challenge of the hike and the sense of accomplishment they felt when they reached the top.

5. Queenstown Bike Park: The Queenstown Bike Park is a great place for families who love to mountain bike. There are plenty of trails to choose from, ranging from easy to difficult, so there's something for everyone. Our kids loved the thrill of riding down the mountain and we all had a great time exploring the different trails.

Overall, we had an amazing time in Queenstown and would highly recommend it for families with children. There are plenty of fun and exciting activities to keep everyone entertained, and the scenery is simply breathtaking. We can't wait to go back and explore more of this beautiful part of New Zealand.
