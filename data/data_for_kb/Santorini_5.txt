As a couple in our mid-thirties, we recently visited Santorini and were absolutely blown away by the beauty and romance of the island. Here are some of our favorite attractions and activities that we would highly recommend for couples visiting Santorini:

1. Oia Sunset: The sunset in Oia is one of the most famous and beautiful sights in Santorini. We watched the sunset from a rooftop bar overlooking the caldera, and it was truly breathtaking. The colors of the sky and the sea were stunning, and the atmosphere was incredibly romantic. We would recommend getting there early to find a good spot and enjoy a drink while you wait for the sun to set.

2. Red Beach: We took a boat tour of the caldera and stopped at the Red Beach, which was one of the highlights of our trip. The beach is surrounded by red cliffs and the water is crystal clear and perfect for swimming. We spent a few hours here relaxing on the beach and taking in the beautiful scenery.

3. Wine Tasting: Santorini is known for its excellent wine, and we had a great time visiting a local winery for a tasting. We learned about the unique grape varieties that are grown on the island and tried several different wines, including a delicious sweet dessert wine. The views from the winery were also stunning, and we would recommend visiting during the late afternoon to watch the sunset over the vineyards.

4. Fira Town: The capital of Santorini, Fira, is a beautiful town with narrow streets, whitewashed buildings, and stunning views of the caldera. We spent a few hours exploring the town, visiting shops and art galleries, and enjoying a meal at a local restaurant. We would recommend taking the cable car up to Fira from the port, as it offers incredible views of the island and the sea.

5. Akrotiri Archaeological Site: This ancient Minoan settlement was buried by a volcanic eruption in the 17th century BC and was only rediscovered in the 1960s. The site is incredibly well-preserved and offers a fascinating glimpse into the past. We spent a few hours exploring the ruins and learning about the history of the site.

Overall, we had an amazing time in Santorini and would highly recommend it for couples looking for a romantic and unforgettable getaway. The island is incredibly beautiful, and there are plenty of activities and attractions to keep you busy, from exploring ancient ruins to relaxing on the beach to enjoying delicious food and wine. We can't wait to go back!
