As a 35-year-old pet owner, I recently visited Queenstown with my furry friend, and I must say that it was an incredible experience. Queenstown is a beautiful city with plenty of activities and attractions for both humans and pets. Here are some of the best things to do in Queenstown with your pet:

1. Take a scenic walk: Queenstown has many beautiful walking trails that are perfect for taking your pet on a stroll. The Queenstown Hill Time Walk is a popular choice, with stunning views of the city and surrounding mountains. The trail is well-maintained and has plenty of spots to rest and take in the scenery.

2. Visit the Queenstown Gardens: The Queenstown Gardens are a beautiful park located in the heart of the city. It's a great place to take your pet for a walk, and there are plenty of benches and picnic tables where you can relax and enjoy the scenery. The gardens are also home to a duck pond, which is a popular spot for pets to play and swim.

3. Go for a boat ride: If you're looking for a unique way to experience Queenstown's stunning scenery, consider taking a boat ride on Lake Wakatipu. There are several companies that offer pet-friendly boat tours, including the TSS Earnslaw Steamship and the Queenstown Water Taxi. Both companies have pet-friendly areas on their boats, and your pet will love the chance to see the city from a different perspective.

4. Visit the Kawarau Bridge: The Kawarau Bridge is the site of the world's first commercial bungee jumping operation, and it's a popular tourist attraction in Queenstown. While you can't take your pet bungee jumping (for obvious reasons), you can still visit the bridge and take in the stunning views of the surrounding mountains. There are plenty of walking trails in the area, and your pet will love exploring the beautiful scenery.

5. Go for a swim: Queenstown has several pet-friendly beaches where you can take your pet for a swim. Frankton Beach is a popular choice, with plenty of space for your pet to run and play. The beach is also home to a dog park, where your pet can socialize with other dogs and play fetch.

Overall, Queenstown is an incredible destination for pet owners. There are plenty of activities and attractions to enjoy with your furry friend, and the city is incredibly pet-friendly. Whether you're looking for a scenic walk, a boat ride, or a day at the beach, Queenstown has something for everyone.
