As a 35-year-old, I recently traveled to Marrakech with my pets and had an amazing time exploring the city's many attractions and activities. Here are some of my top recommendations for pet-friendly things to do in Marrakech:

First, I recommend visiting the Jardin Majorelle, a beautiful botanical garden created by French painter Jacques Majorelle in the 1920s. The garden is home to a wide variety of plants and flowers, as well as a small museum dedicated to Berber culture. Pets are welcome in the garden, as long as they are on a leash and well-behaved. My pets loved exploring the winding paths and taking in the sights and smells of the garden.

Next, I recommend taking a stroll through the medina, Marrakech's old city. The medina is a maze of narrow streets and alleyways, filled with shops, markets, and restaurants. While some areas of the medina can be crowded and chaotic, there are plenty of quiet, pet-friendly corners to explore. I recommend taking your time and wandering through the winding streets, taking in the sights and sounds of the city.

Another great option for pet owners is the Menara Gardens, a large park located just outside the city center. The gardens are home to a beautiful lake, as well as a number of walking trails and picnic areas. Pets are welcome in the gardens, as long as they are on a leash and well-behaved. My pets loved running around in the open space and taking in the fresh air.

Finally, I recommend visiting the Palmeraie, a large palm grove located just outside the city. The Palmeraie is home to a number of luxury hotels and resorts, as well as a number of hiking and biking trails. Pets are welcome in the Palmeraie, as long as they are on a leash and well-behaved. I recommend taking a leisurely stroll through the palm grove, taking in the beautiful scenery and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere.

In conclusion, Marrakech is a great destination for pet owners, with plenty of pet-friendly attractions and activities to enjoy. Whether you're exploring the winding streets of the medina, taking a stroll through the Jardin Majorelle, or relaxing in the Palmeraie, there's something for everyone in this vibrant and colorful city.
