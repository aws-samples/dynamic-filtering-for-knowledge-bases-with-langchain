As a 30-year-old solo traveler, I recently visited Bora Bora and had an amazing time exploring the island's many attractions. Here are some of my top recommendations for other solo travelers looking to make the most of their trip:

First, I would highly recommend taking a boat tour around the island. There are several companies that offer tours, and they provide a great way to see the stunning scenery and learn about the island's history and culture. I chose a tour that included stops at several different snorkeling spots, where I was able to swim with tropical fish and even see some reef sharks up close. The tour also included a stop at a small island where I could relax on the beach and enjoy a picnic lunch.

Another must-visit attraction in Bora Bora is the famous Mount Otemanu. This towering peak is the island's highest point and offers breathtaking views of the surrounding lagoon and islands. There are several hiking trails that lead to the summit, ranging from easy to challenging. I chose a moderate trail that took about two hours to complete and provided plenty of opportunities to take in the stunning scenery along the way.

For those looking for a more relaxed experience, I would recommend spending some time at one of the island's many beaches. Matira Beach is a popular spot, with crystal-clear waters and soft white sand. It's a great place to relax, swim, or even try some water sports like paddleboarding or kayaking. I spent a few hours here one afternoon, soaking up the sun and enjoying the beautiful views.

Finally, I would recommend taking a day trip to one of the nearby islands. There are several small islands that are easily accessible by boat, and they offer a chance to escape the crowds and experience a more authentic side of Polynesian culture. I chose to visit the island of Taha'a, which is known for its vanilla plantations and beautiful beaches. I spent the day exploring the island, visiting a local plantation, and relaxing on the beach.

Overall, I had an incredible time in Bora Bora and would highly recommend it to other solo travelers. The island has something for everyone, from adventure seekers to those looking for a more relaxed experience. And with its stunning scenery and friendly locals, it's a destination that is sure to leave a lasting impression.
