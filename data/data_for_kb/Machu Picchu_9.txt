As a 40-year-old traveler, I recently had the opportunity to visit Machu Picchu with my two beloved pets, a dog and a cat. While it may seem unconventional to bring pets on such a trip, I was determined to make it work, and I'm glad I did. Here are some of the top attractions and activities I would recommend for anyone traveling with pets in Machu Picchu.

First and foremost, I would recommend visiting the ancient Inca ruins of Machu Picchu itself. While pets are not allowed inside the ruins, there are plenty of areas nearby where you can take in the stunning views and get a sense of the site's history and significance. The Inca Trail is a popular option for hikers, and while pets are not allowed on the trail, there are plenty of other hiking options in the area that are pet-friendly.

Another must-see attraction in Machu Picchu is the Sacred Valley. This beautiful valley is home to a number of Inca ruins, including Pisac and Ollantaytambo, both of which are pet-friendly. The valley is also a great place to go horseback riding, with plenty of trails and stables that cater to pet owners.

If you're looking for a more relaxed activity, consider taking a train ride through the Andes. The Vistadome train offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains and valleys, and pets are allowed on board as long as they are kept in carriers. This is a great way to take in the beauty of the area without having to hike or climb.

Finally, I would recommend visiting the town of Aguas Calientes, which is the gateway to Machu Picchu. While pets are not allowed in many of the town's shops and restaurants, there are plenty of outdoor areas where you can take your pet for a walk or a run. The town is also home to a number of pet-friendly hotels and hostels, so you can rest assured that your pet will be comfortable during your stay.

In conclusion, while traveling with pets in Machu Picchu may require some extra planning and preparation, it is definitely possible and can be a rewarding experience. With a little research and some flexibility, you and your pet can enjoy all that this beautiful destination has to offer.
