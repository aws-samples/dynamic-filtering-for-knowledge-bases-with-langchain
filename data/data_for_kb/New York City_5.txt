As a couple in our mid-thirties, we recently had the pleasure of visiting New York City for the first time. We were blown away by the energy and excitement of the city, and we had an amazing time exploring all that it had to offer. Here are some of our favorite attractions and activities that we would highly recommend for couples visiting New York City:

1. Central Park: Central Park is a must-visit for any couple visiting New York City. With over 800 acres of green space, there are plenty of opportunities for a romantic stroll, a picnic, or even a bike ride. We loved exploring the park's many winding paths, taking in the beautiful scenery, and stopping to watch the street performers and musicians.

2. The High Line: The High Line is a unique park built on an old elevated railway line in Manhattan. It offers stunning views of the city and is a great place to take a leisurely walk and enjoy the fresh air. We loved strolling along the park's winding paths, taking in the views of the Hudson River and the city skyline, and stopping to admire the many art installations and gardens along the way.

3. The Metropolitan Museum of Art: The Met is one of the world's greatest museums, and it's a must-visit for any art lover. With an extensive collection of art from around the world, there's something for everyone to enjoy. We spent hours wandering through the museum's many galleries, admiring the paintings, sculptures, and artifacts, and taking in the beautiful architecture of the building itself.

4. The Brooklyn Bridge: Walking across the Brooklyn Bridge is a classic New York City experience, and it's a great way to take in the city's iconic skyline. The bridge offers stunning views of the East River, the Statue of Liberty, and the Manhattan skyline, and it's a great place to take a romantic stroll and enjoy the fresh air.

5. Broadway Show: No trip to New York City would be complete without seeing a Broadway show. From classic musicals to cutting-edge dramas, there's something for everyone to enjoy. We saw a performance of "Hamilton" and were blown away by the talent and energy of the cast. It was an unforgettable experience that we would highly recommend for any couple visiting the city.
