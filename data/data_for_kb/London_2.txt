As a 30-year-old pet owner, I recently visited London with my two dogs and had a fantastic time exploring the city's many pet-friendly attractions. Here are some of my top recommendations for anyone traveling to London with their furry friends:

First, I highly recommend taking a stroll through Hyde Park, one of London's largest and most beautiful parks. The park is fully accessible to pets, and there are plenty of walking trails, ponds, and green spaces for your dogs to explore. We spent a lovely afternoon walking through the park, taking in the sights and sounds of the city, and enjoying the fresh air.

Another must-visit attraction for pet owners is the London Eye. While you can't take your pets on the ride itself, there is a designated pet-friendly area where you can leave your dogs while you enjoy the views of the city. The staff were very friendly and accommodating, and my dogs were well taken care of while I was on the ride.

If you're looking for a more active adventure, consider renting a boat on the Serpentine Lake in Hyde Park. The lake is fully accessible to pets, and there are plenty of boats available for rent. We spent a fun-filled afternoon paddling around the lake, taking in the views of the park and the city beyond.

Finally, I recommend checking out one of London's many pet-friendly cafes or pubs. We visited the Dog and Duck pub in Soho, which has a lovely outdoor seating area where pets are welcome. The staff were very friendly and accommodating, and we enjoyed a delicious meal while our dogs relaxed at our feet.

Overall, I highly recommend visiting London with your pets. The city has plenty of pet-friendly attractions and activities to offer, and my dogs and I had a wonderful time exploring all that the city has to offer. Whether you're looking for a relaxing stroll through a park or a more active adventure, London has something for everyone.
