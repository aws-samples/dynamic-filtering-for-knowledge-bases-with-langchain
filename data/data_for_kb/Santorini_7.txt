As a 35-year-old mother of two young children, I recently visited Santorini with my family and had a fantastic time. Here are some of the top attractions and activities we enjoyed during our stay.

One of the highlights of our trip was visiting the Akrotiri Archaeological Site. This well-preserved ancient city offers a unique glimpse into Santorini's past and is a great way to introduce children to history. The site is well-organized, with clear signage and informative displays, and there are plenty of opportunities for children to explore and learn.

Another must-visit attraction is the Red Beach. This stunning stretch of coastline is famous for its red sand and dramatic cliffs, and it's a great place to spend a day swimming and sunbathing. The beach can get crowded during peak season, so we recommend arriving early to secure a spot. There are also several nearby restaurants and cafes where you can grab a bite to eat.

If you're looking for a more active adventure, consider taking a boat tour of the caldera. These tours offer breathtaking views of the island's volcanic landscape and provide a unique perspective on Santorini's history and geology. Many tours also include stops at the hot springs and other nearby islands, making for a fun and educational day out.

For a more relaxed day, consider visiting the black sand beach of Perissa. This beach is perfect for families with young children, as the water is shallow and calm, and there are plenty of amenities nearby, including restaurants, cafes, and shops. We spent a full day here, swimming, sunbathing, and exploring the nearby town.

Finally, no trip to Santorini would be complete without visiting Oia, the island's most famous village. Known for its stunning sunsets and picturesque white-washed buildings, Oia is a must-visit destination for any family traveling to Santorini. We spent a day exploring the village, visiting the local shops and galleries, and taking in the breathtaking views.

In conclusion, Santorini is a fantastic destination for families with children. With its stunning scenery, rich history, and abundance of activities, there's something for everyone to enjoy. Whether you're interested in history, adventure, or simply relaxing on the beach, Santorini has it all. We highly recommend adding this beautiful island to your travel bucket list.
