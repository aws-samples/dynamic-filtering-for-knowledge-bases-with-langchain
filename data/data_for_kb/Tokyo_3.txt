As a couple in our early thirties, we recently had the opportunity to visit Tokyo and were absolutely blown away by the city's energy, culture, and endless entertainment options. Here are some of our favorite attractions and activities that we would highly recommend for couples visiting Tokyo.

First and foremost, we recommend visiting the Senso-ji Temple in Asakusa. This ancient temple is one of Tokyo's most famous landmarks and is a must-see for anyone visiting the city. The temple is surrounded by a bustling shopping district, where you can find everything from traditional Japanese souvenirs to delicious street food. We spent hours wandering through the narrow streets, exploring the shops, and taking in the sights and sounds of the temple.

Another must-visit attraction is the Tokyo Skytree. This towering structure is the tallest building in Japan and offers breathtaking views of the city from its observation decks. We recommend visiting at sunset, when the city lights begin to twinkle below you and the sky turns a beautiful shade of pink and orange. The Skytree also has a number of restaurants and shops, making it a great place to spend an evening.

If you're looking for a more relaxing activity, we recommend taking a stroll through the Meiji Shrine. This peaceful shrine is located in the heart of Tokyo and is surrounded by a beautiful forest. It's the perfect place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and connect with nature. We enjoyed walking through the forest, admiring the shrine's architecture, and watching the traditional Japanese weddings that were taking place.

For foodies, Tokyo is a paradise. There are countless restaurants, cafes, and food stalls to choose from, offering everything from sushi and ramen to yakitori and tempura. We recommend checking out the Tsukiji Fish Market, where you can sample some of the freshest seafood in the world. We also enjoyed exploring the various food stalls in the Shinjuku and Shibuya districts, where we tried everything from takoyaki to okonomiyaki.

Finally, we recommend checking out Tokyo's nightlife. The city has a vibrant bar and club scene, with something to suit every taste. We recommend checking out the Golden Gai district in Shinjuku, where you'll find over 200 tiny bars and clubs, each with its own unique atmosphere. We also enjoyed exploring the various izakayas, or Japanese pubs, in the Roppongi district, where we sampled a variety of sake and Japanese beers.

In conclusion, Tokyo is an incredible city that offers something for everyone. Whether you're interested in history, culture, food, or nightlife, you'll find it all in Tokyo. We highly recommend visiting the Senso-ji Temple, Tokyo Skytree, Meiji Shrine, and exploring the city's food and nightlife scene. We can't wait to return to Tokyo and continue exploring all that this amazing city has to offer.
