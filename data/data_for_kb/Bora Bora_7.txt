As a 38-year-old mother of two, I recently had the pleasure of visiting Bora Bora with my family, and I can confidently say that it was an unforgettable experience. The island is known for its stunning beauty, crystal-clear waters, and luxurious resorts, and it did not disappoint. Here are some of the top attractions and activities that we enjoyed during our stay:

The first thing that struck me about Bora Bora was the beauty of its beaches. The island is surrounded by a turquoise lagoon, and the beaches are made up of soft, white sand. We spent many hours lounging on the beach, swimming in the warm waters, and exploring the nearby coral reefs. The kids loved snorkeling and seeing all of the colorful fish and sea turtles.

Another must-see attraction in Bora Bora is Mount Otemanu. This towering peak is the island's highest point and offers breathtaking views of the surrounding lagoon and islands. We took a guided hike to the top, which was challenging but well worth it. The kids were fascinated by the unique flora and fauna that we encountered along the way, and the views from the summit were truly spectacular.

One of the highlights of our trip was taking a boat tour of the lagoon. We saw many different types of fish, sharks, and rays, and even had the opportunity to swim with them in their natural habitat. The kids were thrilled to be so close to these amazing creatures, and it was a great way to learn about the local marine life.

Another activity that we enjoyed was visiting the Bora Bora Turtle Sanctuary. This non-profit organization is dedicated to protecting the island's sea turtles and their habitat, and we had the opportunity to learn about their conservation efforts and even feed the turtles. The kids loved getting up close and personal with these gentle creatures, and it was a great way to teach them about the importance of conservation.

Finally, we spent a day at the Bora Bora Lagoonarium, which is a large aquarium that is home to many different types of marine life. We had the opportunity to feed the fish, touch the stingrays, and even swim with the sharks. The kids loved this interactive experience, and it was a great way to learn about the different species that call Bora Bora home.

In conclusion, Bora Bora is an incredible destination for families with children. The island's natural beauty, warm climate, and abundance of activities make it the perfect place to create lasting memories. Whether you're lounging on the beach, hiking to the top of Mount Otemanu, or swimming with sharks, there's something for everyone in Bora Bora. I highly recommend adding this destination to your travel bucket list.
