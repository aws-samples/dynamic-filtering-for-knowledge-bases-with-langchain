As a 25-year-old solo traveler, I recently visited Machu Picchu and was blown away by its beauty and history. Here are some of the top attractions and activities I recommend for other solo travelers:

First, I recommend hiking the Inca Trail. This four-day trek takes you through the Andes Mountains and ends at Machu Picchu. It's a challenging hike, but the views are worth it. I met some great people along the way and felt a sense of accomplishment when I finally reached the top.

Next, I recommend exploring the ruins of Machu Picchu. There are many different areas to explore, including the Temple of the Sun, the Intihuatana Stone, and the Temple of the Three Windows. I spent hours wandering around and taking in the history and beauty of the site.

For those who want to learn more about the history of Machu Picchu, I recommend taking a guided tour. My tour guide was knowledgeable and passionate about the site and was able to answer all of my questions. I also recommend taking a tour early in the morning, before the crowds arrive.

Another activity I recommend is visiting the Sacred Valley. This area is home to many Inca ruins, including Pisac and Ollantaytambo. I took a day trip from Cusco and was able to see both sites, as well as enjoy some beautiful scenery.

Finally, I recommend taking some time to relax in Aguas Calientes, the town at the base of Machu Picchu. There are many restaurants and shops to explore, as well as hot springs to relax in. I spent a few hours here before catching my train back to Cusco and felt refreshed and ready for my next adventure.

Overall, I highly recommend visiting Machu Picchu as a solo traveler. There are many activities and attractions to enjoy, and the scenery and history are truly breathtaking. Just be sure to pack comfortable shoes and plenty of water, as there is a lot of walking involved.
