As a couple in our early thirties, we recently visited Tokyo and had an amazing time. We stayed in the Shinjuku area, which was a great location for exploring the city. Here are some of our favorite attractions and activities that we would recommend for couples visiting Tokyo:

First, we recommend visiting the Meiji Shrine. This beautiful Shinto shrine is located in a peaceful forest and is a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. We enjoyed walking through the forest and seeing the traditional architecture of the shrine. It was a great way to start our trip and get a sense of Tokyo's cultural heritage.

Next, we recommend checking out the Tokyo Skytree. This towering structure offers stunning views of the city from its observation deck. We went up at sunset and watched as the city lights came on below us. It was a truly breathtaking experience and a great way to see the city from a different perspective.

For foodies, we recommend checking out the Tsukiji Fish Market. This famous market is home to some of the freshest seafood in the world and is a must-visit for any food lover. We enjoyed walking through the market and sampling some of the delicious seafood on offer. We also recommend trying some of the fresh sushi at one of the many restaurants in the area.

Another great activity for couples is taking a stroll through the cherry blossoms in Ueno Park. We visited during the cherry blossom season and were blown away by the beauty of the park. The cherry blossoms were in full bloom and the park was filled with couples taking photos and enjoying the scenery. It was a truly romantic experience and a great way to spend an afternoon in Tokyo.

Finally, we recommend checking out the Robot Restaurant in Shinjuku. This unique attraction features a high-energy show with robots, lasers, and neon lights. It was a fun and entertaining experience that we would recommend for any couple visiting Tokyo.

Overall, we had an amazing time in Tokyo and would highly recommend it as a destination for couples. There is so much to see and do in this vibrant city, and we can't wait to go back and explore more.
