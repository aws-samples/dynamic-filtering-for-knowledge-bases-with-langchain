My wife and I recently visited New York City for our 10th wedding anniversary, and we had an amazing time exploring the city. We stayed in Manhattan and made sure to check out some of the most popular tourist attractions and fun things to do for couples. Here are our top picks:

Central Park: We spent a full day exploring Central Park and loved every minute of it. We rented bikes and rode around the park, stopping to take in the beautiful scenery and people-watch. We also took a rowboat out on the lake and had a picnic in the grass. Central Park is the perfect place to relax and unwind with your partner, and there's always something new to discover.

The High Line: The High Line is a unique park built on an old elevated railway line in Manhattan. We walked the entire length of the park and enjoyed the stunning views of the city and the Hudson River. The park is filled with art installations, gardens, and benches, making it the perfect place to take a leisurely stroll with your partner.

The Brooklyn Bridge: We took a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge one evening and were blown away by the views of the city skyline. The bridge is lit up at night, and it was a romantic and picturesque way to see the city. We stopped halfway across the bridge to take in the views and snap some photos.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art: We spent an entire day at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and still didn't see everything. The museum is massive and has an incredible collection of art from around the world. We loved wandering through the galleries and discovering new artists and works of art. The museum also has a beautiful rooftop garden with stunning views of Central Park.

The Empire State Building: We visited the Empire State Building at night and were treated to breathtaking views of the city. The observation deck was crowded, but we still managed to find a spot to take in the views and snap some photos. The building is lit up at night, and it was a magical experience to see the city from such a high vantage point.

In conclusion, New York City is a fantastic destination for couples looking for a romantic getaway. There are so many things to see and do, and we only scratched the surface during our visit. We can't wait to go back and explore more of this incredible city.
