As a 35-year-old solo traveler, I recently had the opportunity to visit Machu Picchu, one of the most iconic tourist destinations in the world. Here are some of the top attractions and activities I would recommend for other solo travelers:

First and foremost, I would recommend taking a guided tour of the ancient Inca city itself. The tour will provide you with valuable insights into the history and culture of the Inca civilization, as well as the engineering marvels that allowed them to build such an impressive city in such a remote location. The tour will take you through the main plaza, the temple of the sun, and the temple of the three windows, among other landmarks.

Another must-do activity in Machu Picchu is hiking up Huayna Picchu, the mountain that looms over the city. The hike is challenging, but the views from the top are absolutely breathtaking. You'll get a unique perspective of the city and the surrounding mountains, and you'll feel a sense of accomplishment that will stay with you long after you leave.

If you're interested in learning more about the Inca civilization, I would recommend visiting the Inca Bridge. This is a narrow path that was built by the Incas to connect Machu Picchu to other parts of their empire. The bridge is not for the faint of heart, as it hangs high above the valley floor, but it's an incredible experience that will give you a sense of the ingenuity and bravery of the Inca people.

Finally, I would recommend taking some time to explore the surrounding area. There are many beautiful hiking trails that will take you through the Andean countryside, where you can see local villages, stunning vistas, and even some wildlife. One of my favorite hikes was the one to the Sun Gate, which offers a panoramic view of Machu Picchu from above.

Overall, I highly recommend visiting Machu Picchu for any solo traveler looking for an unforgettable adventure. The city is awe-inspiring, the hiking is challenging but rewarding, and the history and culture of the Inca civilization are fascinating. Just be sure to book your tickets and tours in advance, as Machu Picchu is a popular destination and can get very crowded during peak season.
