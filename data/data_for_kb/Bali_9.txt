Hi, I'm Jane, a 25-year-old solo traveler who recently visited Bali. I had an amazing time exploring this beautiful island, and I'd like to share some of my favorite attractions and activities for solo travelers.

First on my list is the Tegalalang Rice Terrace. This stunning rice field is located in Ubud and is a must-visit for anyone who loves nature and photography. The terraced fields create a beautiful landscape, and the views are simply breathtaking. I spent hours walking through the fields, taking photos, and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere. It's a great place to relax and unwind, and I highly recommend visiting early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the crowds.

Next up is the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary, also located in Ubud. This forest is home to over 700 monkeys, and it's a great place to get up close and personal with these playful creatures. The forest is filled with ancient temples and statues, and it's a fascinating place to explore. Just be sure to keep your belongings close, as the monkeys are known to be quite mischievous!

Another must-visit attraction in Bali is the Tirta Empul Temple. This temple is famous for its holy spring water, which is believed to have healing properties. Visitors can bathe in the water and participate in a traditional water purification ceremony. The temple is located in the village of Tampak Siring and is surrounded by beautiful gardens and pools. It's a peaceful and spiritual place, and I highly recommend visiting if you're interested in learning more about Balinese culture and religion.

Finally, I'd recommend taking a cooking class in Bali. There are many options available, from traditional Balinese cuisine to modern fusion dishes. I took a class at a local cooking school in Ubud and learned how to make some of my favorite Balinese dishes, such as nasi goreng and gado-gado. It was a fun and educational experience, and I left with some new recipes to try at home.

Overall, I had an amazing time in Bali and would highly recommend it to any solo traveler. There's so much to see and do, and the island has a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere that's perfect for exploring on your own. Just be sure to respect local customs and traditions, and you're sure to have a memorable trip!
