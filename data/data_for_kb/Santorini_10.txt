As a couple in our early thirties, we recently visited Santorini and were absolutely blown away by the beauty and romance of the island. Here are our top recommendations for couples visiting Santorini:

First, we recommend taking a sunset cruise around the caldera. We booked a private catamaran tour with a local company and it was one of the highlights of our trip. The boat sailed around the caldera, stopping at different spots to swim in the crystal-clear waters and explore hidden coves. We watched the sunset from the deck of the boat, sipping champagne and taking in the stunning views of the volcano and the surrounding islands. It was a truly magical experience and the perfect way to start our trip.

Next, we recommend visiting the ancient city of Akrotiri. This well-preserved Minoan settlement was buried under volcanic ash during the eruption of the volcano in 1600 BC and was only rediscovered in the 1960s. We spent a few hours exploring the ruins, which included streets, houses, and even a pottery workshop. The site is well-maintained and provides a fascinating glimpse into the past.

We also recommend taking a day trip to the nearby island of Thirassia. This small island is often overlooked by tourists, but it's a hidden gem that's worth a visit. We took a ferry from Santorini and spent the day exploring the island's quiet streets, swimming in the clear waters, and enjoying a traditional Greek lunch at a local taverna. The island has a much more laid-back vibe than Santorini and it was a nice change of pace.

Of course, no trip to Santorini would be complete without visiting the famous Oia. This picturesque village is known for its stunning sunsets and beautiful architecture. We spent a day wandering the narrow streets, taking in the views, and snapping photos of the iconic blue-domed churches. We also visited some of the local art galleries and shops, where we found some unique souvenirs to take home.

Finally, we recommend taking a wine tour of the island. Santorini is known for its unique volcanic soil, which produces some of the best wines in Greece. We booked a tour with a local company and visited several wineries, where we learned about the wine-making process and tasted some delicious local wines. We even got to meet some of the winemakers and hear their stories about the island's history and culture.

In conclusion, Santorini is a truly magical destination for couples. With its stunning scenery, rich history, and delicious food and wine, it's the perfect place to escape and reconnect with your partner. We highly recommend visiting Santorini and experiencing all that this beautiful island has to offer.
