I am a 45-year-old woman who recently visited Rio de Janeiro with my two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Chihuahua. I wanted to share my experience traveling with pets in Rio de Janeiro and suggest some popular tourist attractions and fun things to do with your furry friends.

First, I recommend visiting the Botanical Garden of Rio de Janeiro. This beautiful garden is home to over 6,000 species of plants and trees, including many rare and exotic species. The garden is pet-friendly, and my dogs loved exploring the different paths and gardens. There are plenty of benches and picnic tables where you can rest and enjoy the scenery, and there is even a pet-friendly cafe where you can grab a bite to eat.

Next, I suggest visiting the Copacabana Beach. This iconic beach is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Rio de Janeiro, and it is also pet-friendly. My dogs loved running around on the sand and playing in the waves. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes along the beach where you can grab a bite to eat, and many of them are pet-friendly as well.

If you are looking for a more active adventure, I recommend hiking up to the Christ the Redeemer statue. This iconic statue is located on top of Mount Corcovado and offers stunning views of the city. The hike is challenging, but it is well worth it for the views. There is a pet-friendly path that leads up to the statue, and there are plenty of places to rest and take in the scenery along the way.

Finally, I suggest visiting the Tijuca National Park. This park is home to the largest urban forest in the world and is a great place to explore with your pets. There are plenty of hiking trails and picnic areas where you can enjoy the scenery, and there are also many wildlife species that call the park home. My dogs loved exploring the different trails and seeing all of the different animals.

Overall, I had a great experience traveling with my pets in Rio de Janeiro. There are plenty of pet-friendly attractions and activities to enjoy, and the city is very welcoming to pets. I highly recommend visiting Rio de Janeiro with your furry friends!
