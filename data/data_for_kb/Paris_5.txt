I am 45 years old and I am a pet owner. I recently visited Paris with my pet and I wanted to share some of the popular tourist attractions and fun things to do in Paris for traveling with pets.

First, I would suggest visiting the Jardin des Tuileries. This beautiful park is located between the Louvre Museum and the Place de la Concorde and is a great place to take a leisurely stroll with your pet. The park has plenty of green space for your pet to run around and play, and there are also several fountains and sculptures to explore. The park is also home to a petanque court, which is a popular French game that is similar to bocce ball.

Another popular tourist attraction that is pet-friendly is the Champ de Mars. This large public park is located near the Eiffel Tower and is a great place to take a picnic with your pet. The park has plenty of grassy areas for your pet to run around and play, and there are also several benches and tables where you can sit and enjoy a meal. The park is also home to several food vendors, so you can grab a bite to eat while you relax with your pet.

If you are looking for something a little more active, I would suggest visiting the Bois de Boulogne. This large park is located on the western edge of Paris and is a great place to go for a walk or a bike ride with your pet. The park has several lakes and ponds, as well as several gardens and playgrounds. The park is also home to several cafes and restaurants, so you can grab a bite to eat while you enjoy the scenery.

Finally, I would suggest visiting the Montmartre neighborhood. This historic neighborhood is located on a hill in the north of Paris and is known for its bohemian atmosphere and stunning views of the city. The neighborhood is home to several pet-friendly cafes and restaurants, as well as several art galleries and shops. The neighborhood is also home to the Sacre-Coeur Basilica, which is a popular tourist attraction and offers stunning views of the city.

Overall, Paris is a great destination for travelers with pets. There are plenty of pet-friendly attractions and activities to enjoy, and the city is very welcoming to pets. Whether you are looking for a relaxing park to take a stroll or an active adventure, Paris has something for everyone.
