I'm a 30-year-old pet owner who recently visited Santorini, Greece with my furry friend. I was excited to explore the island and see what it had to offer for pet owners like myself. Here are some of the popular tourist attractions and fun things to do in Santorini that I would recommend for traveling with pets:

1. Red Beach: This beach is a must-visit for anyone traveling with pets in Santorini. The red sand and clear blue waters make for a beautiful backdrop, and the beach is pet-friendly. There are plenty of rocks and caves for your pet to explore, and the water is shallow enough for them to swim in. Just be sure to bring plenty of water and shade for your pet, as there is little to no shade on the beach.

2. Akrotiri Lighthouse: This historic lighthouse is located on the southern tip of the island and offers stunning views of the Aegean Sea. The area around the lighthouse is pet-friendly, and there are plenty of hiking trails to explore. Just be sure to keep your pet on a leash and clean up after them.

3. Ancient Thera: This archaeological site is located on the top of a mountain and offers panoramic views of the island. While pets are not allowed inside the site, there are plenty of hiking trails and viewpoints nearby that are pet-friendly. Just be sure to bring plenty of water and shade for your pet, as it can get quite hot on the mountain.

4. Perissa Beach: This black sand beach is one of the most popular beaches on the island and is pet-friendly. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby that welcome pets, and the water is shallow enough for them to swim in. Just be sure to bring plenty of water and shade for your pet, as there is little to no shade on the beach.

5. Fira: The capital of Santorini, Fira, is a bustling town with plenty of shops, restaurants, and cafes. While pets are not allowed in many of the indoor establishments, there are plenty of outdoor cafes and restaurants that welcome pets. Just be sure to keep your pet on a leash and clean up after them.

Overall, Santorini is a great destination for pet owners. There are plenty of pet-friendly activities and attractions to enjoy, and the locals are very welcoming to pets. Just be sure to bring plenty of water, shade, and supplies for your pet, and always clean up after them.
