Hi, I'm Sarah, a 32-year-old solo traveler who recently visited Marrakech, Morocco. I had an incredible time exploring this vibrant city and wanted to share some of my favorite attractions and activities for other solo travelers.

First, I recommend visiting the Jemaa el-Fnaa square, the heart of Marrakech. It's a bustling marketplace filled with food stalls, snake charmers, and street performers. I felt safe wandering around on my own, and there were plenty of people to interact with. I tried some delicious Moroccan street food, including tagine and couscous, and even had my fortune told by a local fortune teller.

Next, I suggest checking out the Majorelle Garden, a beautiful botanical garden created by French painter Jacques Majorelle. The garden is filled with colorful plants, fountains, and sculptures, and it's a peaceful escape from the chaos of the city. I spent a few hours wandering around, taking photos, and enjoying the tranquility.

Another must-visit attraction is the Bahia Palace, a stunning 19th-century palace with intricate tilework, carved wooden ceilings, and beautiful courtyards. I took a guided tour of the palace, which was very informative and interesting. The palace is a great place to learn about Moroccan history and culture.

If you're looking for something a little more adventurous, I recommend taking a hot air balloon ride over the Atlas Mountains. I booked a tour through my hotel, and it was an unforgettable experience. The views of the mountains and the city below were breathtaking, and it was a great way to see Marrakech from a different perspective.

Finally, I suggest checking out the souks, or markets, in Marrakech. They're a great place to shop for souvenirs, try local food, and practice your haggling skills. I spent hours wandering through the souks, and I found some great deals on spices, textiles, and jewelry. Just be sure to keep your belongings close and be aware of your surroundings, as the souks can be crowded and chaotic.

Overall, I had an amazing time in Marrakech and would highly recommend it to other solo travelers. The city is safe, welcoming, and full of interesting attractions and activities. I can't wait to go back and explore more of this beautiful country!
