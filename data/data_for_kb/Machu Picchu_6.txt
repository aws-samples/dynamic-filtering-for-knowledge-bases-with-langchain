As a 50-year-old traveler with two small dogs, I was excited to visit Machu Picchu, one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world. While I knew that bringing pets to Machu Picchu was not allowed, I was determined to find alternative ways to enjoy the beauty of the region with my furry companions. Here are some of the top attractions and activities I recommend for pet owners visiting Machu Picchu.

First, I suggest visiting the Sacred Valley of the Incas. This picturesque valley is located just outside of Cusco and is home to several Inca ruins, including Pisac and Ollantaytambo. While pets are not allowed inside the ruins, there are plenty of outdoor activities to enjoy with your furry friends, such as hiking and horseback riding. The valley is also home to several markets where you can find local handicrafts and souvenirs.

Another great option for pet owners is the town of Aguas Calientes, which is the gateway to Machu Picchu. While pets are not allowed on the train or inside the ruins, there are plenty of pet-friendly hotels and restaurants in town. You can also take a scenic walk along the Urubamba River, which offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains.

For those looking for a more active adventure, I recommend hiking the Inca Trail. While pets are not allowed on the trail, there are several alternative routes that are pet-friendly, such as the Salkantay Trek and the Lares Trek. These trails offer breathtaking views of the Andes Mountains and the chance to see local wildlife, such as llamas and alpacas.

Finally, I suggest visiting the Manu National Park. This park is located in the Amazon rainforest and is home to a diverse range of wildlife, including jaguars, monkeys, and parrots. While pets are not allowed in the park, there are several eco-lodges that offer pet-friendly accommodations and guided tours of the rainforest.

In conclusion, while Machu Picchu itself is not pet-friendly, there are plenty of other attractions and activities in the region that are perfect for pet owners. With a little planning and research, you can have a memorable and enjoyable trip with your furry companions.
