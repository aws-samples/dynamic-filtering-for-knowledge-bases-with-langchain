As a family with two kids aged 7 and 9, we recently visited Paris and had an amazing time. Here are some of our top recommendations for family-friendly attractions and activities in the city.

First on our list is the Eiffel Tower. We were all in awe of the tower's sheer size and beauty, and the views from the top were breathtaking. We opted for the elevator ride to the second level, which was a bit pricey but worth it for the convenience and time-saving factor. The kids loved seeing the city from above and spotting all the famous landmarks.

Next, we visited the Louvre Museum, which is a must-see for any art lover. We were a bit worried that the kids might get bored, but they were fascinated by the Egyptian mummies and the famous Mona Lisa. The museum is huge, so we focused on the highlights and made sure to take plenty of breaks. We also took advantage of the free guided tours for families, which were a great way to learn more about the art and keep the kids engaged.

Another highlight of our trip was a boat tour along the Seine River. The kids loved seeing the city from a different perspective, and we all enjoyed the beautiful views of the bridges and buildings along the river. We opted for a tour with commentary in English, which helped us learn more about the history and culture of Paris.

For a more active day, we visited the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont. This park is perfect for families with kids of all ages, with plenty of green space, playgrounds, and walking trails. We rented bikes and explored the park at our own pace, stopping to take in the views and have a picnic lunch. The kids loved the suspension bridge and the artificial lake with its waterfall.

Finally, we visited the Palace of Versailles, which is a bit outside of Paris but definitely worth the trip. The palace is stunning, with ornate rooms and gardens that are truly breathtaking. We opted for a guided tour, which helped us learn more about the history of the palace and its famous residents. The kids loved exploring the gardens and watching the fountain show.

Overall, we had an amazing time in Paris and would highly recommend it for families with kids. There's so much to see and do, and the city has a magical atmosphere that's perfect for creating lasting memories.
