As a 35-year-old family member, I recently visited New York City with my family, and we had a fantastic time exploring the city's many attractions. Here are some of our favorite places to visit and things to do in New York City for families.

The first place we visited was the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. We took a ferry from Battery Park to Liberty Island, where we had an up-close view of the Statue of Liberty. We then took another ferry to Ellis Island, where we learned about the history of immigration to the United States. The museum on Ellis Island was particularly interesting, with exhibits that showcased the experiences of immigrants who came to America in search of a better life.

Next, we visited Central Park, which is a must-visit destination for families. The park has something for everyone, from playgrounds and picnic areas to bike paths and walking trails. We rented a rowboat and spent a relaxing afternoon on the lake, taking in the beautiful scenery. We also visited the Central Park Zoo, which has a variety of animals, including sea lions, penguins, and snow leopards.

Another popular attraction for families is the American Museum of Natural History. The museum has an extensive collection of exhibits, including dinosaurs, space, and human origins. We spent hours exploring the exhibits and learned a lot about the natural world. The museum also has a planetarium, which offers shows about the night sky and space exploration.

Finally, we visited the Empire State Building, which offers stunning views of the city from its observation deck. We visited at night, and the city lights were breathtaking. The observation deck has both indoor and outdoor areas, so you can enjoy the view no matter the weather.

In addition to these attractions, there are many other fun things to do in New York City for families. We also visited the Children's Museum of Manhattan, which has interactive exhibits for kids of all ages. We also took a stroll through Times Square, which is always bustling with activity. And of course, no trip to New York City would be complete without trying some of the city's famous food, such as pizza, bagels, and hot dogs.

Overall, we had a great time in New York City and would highly recommend it as a family-friendly destination. There is so much to see and do in the city that you could easily spend a week or more exploring all that it has to offer.
