My husband and I recently celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary in Queenstown, New Zealand. We had an incredible time exploring this beautiful town and all it has to offer. Here are some of our favorite attractions and activities that we would recommend to other couples visiting Queenstown.

First on our list is the Skyline Gondola. This is a must-do attraction in Queenstown. The gondola takes you up to the top of Bob's Peak, where you can enjoy stunning views of the town and Lake Wakatipu. Once you're at the top, you can take a luge ride down the mountain, which is a fun and exciting way to experience the scenery. We also enjoyed the restaurant at the top, which offers a delicious buffet and a great view.

Next, we recommend taking a scenic flight over Milford Sound. This was one of the highlights of our trip. The flight takes you over some of the most beautiful landscapes in New Zealand, including snow-capped mountains, glaciers, and waterfalls. We chose a helicopter tour, which allowed us to land on a glacier and explore the ice caves. It was an unforgettable experience that we would highly recommend.

For those who love adventure, Queenstown has plenty of options. We went bungee jumping at the Kawarau Bridge, which is the original bungee jumping site in New Zealand. The jump was terrifying but also exhilarating, and we felt a huge sense of accomplishment afterward. We also went jet boating on the Shotover River, which was a fun and fast-paced way to experience the river.

Finally, we recommend taking a wine tour in the nearby Gibbston Valley. This region is known for its Pinot Noir, and there are several wineries to choose from. We visited three wineries and enjoyed tasting their wines and learning about the winemaking process. The scenery in the valley is also beautiful, with rolling hills and vineyards as far as the eye can see.

Overall, we had an amazing time in Queenstown and would highly recommend it to other couples looking for a romantic getaway. There is so much to see and do in this beautiful town, and we can't wait to go back and explore more.

Sincerely,

Jane and John, age 35.
