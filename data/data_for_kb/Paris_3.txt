As a 35-year-old mother of two, I recently visited Paris with my family and had an amazing time. Here are some of the popular tourist attractions and fun things to do in Paris that we enjoyed:

The Eiffel Tower: This iconic landmark is a must-visit for any family visiting Paris. We took the elevator to the top of the tower and enjoyed breathtaking views of the city. The kids loved seeing the tower lit up at night, and we even got to see it sparkle every hour on the hour.

The Louvre Museum: This world-famous museum is home to some of the most famous works of art in the world, including the Mona Lisa. While the museum can be overwhelming for young children, we found that the kids were fascinated by the Egyptian and Greek antiquities exhibits. We also took advantage of the museum's family-friendly resources, such as audio guides and activity books.

The Champs-Élysées: This famous avenue is a great place to take a stroll and do some shopping. We enjoyed window shopping at the high-end stores and stopping for a crepe at one of the many street vendors. The kids loved seeing the Arc de Triomphe at the end of the avenue.

The Palace of Versailles: This former royal residence is a short train ride from Paris and is a must-visit for any history buff. We took a guided tour of the palace and gardens, which was both informative and entertaining. The kids loved seeing the opulent rooms and the stunning gardens.

Disneyland Paris: This theme park is a must-visit for any family with young children. We spent a full day at the park and enjoyed all of the rides and shows. The kids loved meeting their favorite Disney characters and watching the parades.

In addition to these popular attractions, we also enjoyed taking a boat tour along the Seine River, visiting the Notre Dame Cathedral, and exploring the Montmartre neighborhood. Paris is a city that has something for everyone, and we can't wait to return and explore more of what it has to offer.
