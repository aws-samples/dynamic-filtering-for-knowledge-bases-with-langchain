I am a 40-year-old pet owner who recently visited New York City with my two dogs. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the city is very pet-friendly and offers a variety of activities and attractions for pet owners. Here are some of my top recommendations for traveling with pets in New York City:

Central Park: Central Park is a must-visit for any pet owner visiting New York City. The park is massive and offers plenty of space for dogs to run and play. There are also several off-leash areas where dogs can roam freely. I recommend visiting the Great Lawn, which is a large grassy area in the middle of the park, or the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, which offers beautiful views of the city skyline.

High Line: The High Line is a unique park built on an old elevated railway line. It offers stunning views of the city and is a great place to take a leisurely stroll with your pet. The park is pet-friendly, and there are plenty of benches and seating areas where you can rest and take in the views. I recommend visiting early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the crowds.

Brooklyn Bridge Park: Brooklyn Bridge Park is a beautiful waterfront park that offers stunning views of the Manhattan skyline. The park is pet-friendly and has several off-leash areas where dogs can run and play. I recommend visiting the Pier 6 section of the park, which has a large dog run and plenty of space for dogs to play.

Washington Square Park: Washington Square Park is a historic park in Greenwich Village that is popular with both locals and tourists. The park is pet-friendly and has plenty of space for dogs to run and play. I recommend visiting the park in the early morning or late afternoon when it's not as crowded.

Overall, I highly recommend visiting New York City with your pet. The city has plenty of pet-friendly activities and attractions, and there are plenty of dog-friendly restaurants and cafes where you can grab a bite to eat. Just be sure to follow the city's leash laws and clean up after your pet.
