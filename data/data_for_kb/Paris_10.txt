As a mother of two young children, I recently had the pleasure of visiting Paris with my family. We had an amazing time exploring the city and discovering all the fun things it has to offer for families with kids. Here are some of our favorite attractions and activities:

The Eiffel Tower is a must-visit for any family traveling to Paris. My kids were in awe of the towering structure and loved taking the elevator to the top for breathtaking views of the city. We also enjoyed walking around the base of the tower and watching the light show that takes place every hour on the hour after sunset.

Another family-friendly attraction we loved was the Louvre Museum. While it may seem like an unlikely destination for kids, the museum has a lot to offer families with children. We took a guided tour specifically designed for families, which allowed us to see some of the museum's most famous works of art while keeping our kids engaged and entertained. The tour included interactive activities and games that helped bring the art to life for our kids, and they had a blast learning about the history and culture of France.

For a more active day out, we spent a day at the Jardin des Tuileries, a beautiful park located between the Louvre Museum and the Place de la Concorde. The park has plenty of green space for kids to run around and play, as well as a carousel, a puppet theater, and a small amusement park with rides and games. We also enjoyed taking a boat ride on the nearby Seine River, which offered a unique perspective of the city and its landmarks.

One of our favorite experiences in Paris was taking a cooking class at La Cuisine Paris. The class was designed specifically for families with kids, and we had a blast learning how to make classic French dishes like crepes and ratatouille. The instructors were patient and engaging, and they made the experience fun and educational for both kids and adults. We left the class with a newfound appreciation for French cuisine and some new recipes to try at home.

Finally, we couldn't visit Paris without taking a trip to Disneyland Paris. While it may not be as large or elaborate as the Disneyland Resort in California or Florida, Disneyland Paris still has plenty of magic and excitement to offer families with kids. We spent a day exploring the park's many rides and attractions, including the iconic Sleeping Beauty Castle and the thrilling Space Mountain roller coaster. We also enjoyed watching the park's many parades and shows, which were entertaining for both kids and adults.

Overall, we had an amazing time in Paris and would highly recommend it as a family-friendly destination. With so many fun things to do and see, it's the perfect place to create lasting memories with your loved ones.
