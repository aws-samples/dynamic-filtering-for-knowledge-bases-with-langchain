As a family with two children, ages 6 and 8, we recently visited London and had a fantastic time exploring the city's many attractions. Here are some of our top recommendations for families visiting London:

The London Eye: This iconic Ferris wheel offers stunning views of the city and is a must-visit attraction for families. The ride takes about 30 minutes, giving you plenty of time to take in the sights. We visited during the day and at night, and both experiences were breathtaking. The kids loved seeing all of the famous landmarks from such a unique perspective.

The Tower of London: This historic castle is a great place to learn about London's rich history. We took a guided tour with one of the Yeoman Warders, also known as Beefeaters, who shared fascinating stories about the castle's past. The kids were particularly interested in the Crown Jewels, which are on display in the Jewel House. We also enjoyed seeing the ravens, which are said to protect the Tower.

The British Museum: This museum is home to an incredible collection of artifacts from around the world, including the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles. The kids were fascinated by the mummies in the Egyptian exhibit and enjoyed exploring the museum's many galleries. The museum offers family-friendly activities, such as scavenger hunts and workshops, which are a great way to keep the kids engaged.

Hyde Park: This large park is a great place to spend a day outdoors with the family. We enjoyed a picnic on the lawn, fed the ducks in the lake, and took a ride on the park's famous pedal boats. The kids also loved exploring the park's many playgrounds and gardens.

The London Zoo: This world-famous zoo is home to over 750 species of animals, including lions, tigers, and giraffes. The kids loved seeing all of the animals up close and enjoyed the zoo's many interactive exhibits, such as the petting zoo and the butterfly house. The zoo also offers family-friendly shows and activities, such as animal feedings and talks.

Overall, we had a fantastic time in London and would highly recommend it as a family-friendly destination. There are so many things to see and do in the city, and we can't wait to go back and explore more!
