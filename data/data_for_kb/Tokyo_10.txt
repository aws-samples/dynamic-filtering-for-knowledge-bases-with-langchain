As a couple in our mid-thirties, we recently had the pleasure of visiting Tokyo for the first time. We were blown away by the city's vibrant culture, delicious food, and endless entertainment options. Here are our top recommendations for couples visiting Tokyo:

1. Tsukiji Fish Market: This famous fish market is a must-visit for foodies. We arrived early in the morning to watch the tuna auction and then enjoyed a delicious sushi breakfast at one of the many restaurants in the market. It was an unforgettable experience and a great way to start our day.

2. Meiji Shrine: This peaceful shrine is located in the heart of Tokyo and is a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. We loved walking through the tranquil forest and exploring the beautiful shrine buildings. It was a perfect spot for a romantic stroll and a great place to take some photos.

3. Shibuya Crossing: This iconic crossing is a must-see for any visitor to Tokyo. We loved watching the crowds of people crossing the street from the vantage point of the Starbucks on the second floor. It was a fun and unique experience that we will never forget.

4. Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden: This beautiful garden is a great place to relax and unwind. We spent a lazy afternoon strolling through the gardens, admiring the cherry blossoms, and enjoying a picnic lunch. It was a perfect way to spend a sunny afternoon in Tokyo.

5. Robot Restaurant: This unique show is unlike anything we have ever seen before. We loved the bright lights, loud music, and crazy robots. It was a fun and entertaining experience that we would highly recommend to any couple visiting Tokyo.

In addition to these attractions, we also recommend checking out the Tokyo Skytree, the Imperial Palace, and the Akihabara district. Tokyo has so much to offer and we can't wait to go back and explore more of this amazing city.
