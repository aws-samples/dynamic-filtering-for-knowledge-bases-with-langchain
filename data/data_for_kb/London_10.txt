As a family of four with two children aged 8 and 10, we recently spent a week in London and had a fantastic time exploring all the city has to offer. Here are some of our top recommendations for family-friendly attractions and activities in London:

The Tower of London: This historic castle and former prison is a must-visit for families interested in history and architecture. Our kids loved seeing the Crown Jewels and learning about the tower's many ghost stories. We also took a guided tour with one of the Yeoman Warders, also known as Beefeaters, who shared fascinating stories about the tower's past.

The London Eye: This giant Ferris wheel offers stunning views of the city and is a great way to get a sense of London's layout. We went on a clear day and could see for miles in every direction. The ride is slow and peaceful, making it a perfect activity for families with young children.

The British Museum: This world-renowned museum is home to an incredible collection of artifacts from around the globe. Our kids loved seeing the Rosetta Stone and the mummies in the Egyptian exhibit. The museum also offers family-friendly tours and activities, including scavenger hunts and art workshops.

Hyde Park: This large park in the center of London is a great place to spend a sunny day. We rented bikes and explored the park's many trails and gardens, and our kids loved playing in the park's large playground. We also took a boat ride on the Serpentine, the park's large lake, which was a fun and relaxing way to spend an afternoon.

The Science Museum: This interactive museum is a must-visit for families with curious kids. Our children loved the hands-on exhibits, including the flight simulator and the earthquake simulator. The museum also offers a variety of workshops and events for families, including science shows and storytelling sessions.

In addition to these attractions, we also enjoyed taking a river cruise along the Thames, visiting the Covent Garden market, and seeing a show at the West End theater district. London is a vibrant and exciting city with something for everyone, and we can't wait to return and explore more of what it has to offer.
