As a couple in our early thirties, we recently visited Rio de Janeiro and had an amazing time. Here are some of our top recommendations for things to do in the city:

First, we recommend visiting Christ the Redeemer. This iconic statue is a must-see for any visitor to Rio, and the views from the top are simply breathtaking. We took a tour that included transportation to and from the statue, as well as a guide who provided us with interesting information about the history and significance of the site.

Next, we suggest taking a stroll along Copacabana Beach. The beach is long and wide, with plenty of space to walk, sunbathe, or play in the waves. We loved people-watching and trying out some of the local street food, such as pastels and acai bowls.

If you're looking for a more active adventure, we recommend hiking up to the top of Sugarloaf Mountain. The hike is moderately difficult, but the views from the top are well worth the effort. We took a guided tour that included transportation to and from the mountain, as well as a safety briefing and equipment rental.

Finally, we suggest visiting the Selaron Steps. This colorful staircase is a unique and vibrant landmark in Rio, and it's a great place to take some photos. We loved exploring the surrounding neighborhood, which is full of street art and local shops.

Overall, we had an amazing time in Rio de Janeiro and would highly recommend it to any couple looking for a fun and romantic getaway. There's so much to see and do in the city, and we can't wait to go back and explore more!
