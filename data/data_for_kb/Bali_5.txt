I recently visited Bali with my family, including my two children aged 7 and 10. We had an amazing time exploring the island and experiencing all it had to offer. Here are some of the top attractions and activities we recommend for families with children:

1. Waterbom Bali: This water park is a must-visit for families with children. It has a variety of water slides, a lazy river, and a wave pool. The park is well-maintained and has plenty of shaded areas to relax in. Our kids loved the slides and we enjoyed the wave pool and lazy river.

2. Bali Zoo: The Bali Zoo is a great place to take kids of all ages. It has a variety of animals, including elephants, tigers, and orangutans. We took a behind-the-scenes tour and got to feed some of the animals, which was a highlight for our kids. The zoo also has a playground and a petting zoo, which our kids loved.

3. Bali Bird Park: The Bali Bird Park is home to over 1,000 birds from 250 different species. It's a great place to learn about birds and see some rare and exotic species up close. Our kids loved the bird shows and the opportunity to hold some of the birds.

4. Bali Safari and Marine Park: This park is a great place to see a variety of animals, including lions, tigers, and elephants. We took a safari tour and got to see the animals up close. The park also has a water park and a theater, which our kids enjoyed.

5. Ubud Monkey Forest: The Ubud Monkey Forest is a must-visit for any family visiting Bali. It's home to over 700 monkeys and is a great place to see them up close. Our kids loved feeding the monkeys and watching them play.

Overall, we had a fantastic time in Bali and would highly recommend it for families with children. There are plenty of activities and attractions to keep everyone entertained, and the island's natural beauty is truly breathtaking.
