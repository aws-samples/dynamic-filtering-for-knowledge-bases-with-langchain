I'm a 35-year-old mother of two young children, ages 4 and 6, and we recently visited Bora Bora. Here are some of the popular tourist attractions and fun things we did during our trip:

1. Snorkeling and Scuba Diving: Bora Bora is known for its crystal-clear waters and vibrant marine life, making it an ideal destination for snorkeling and scuba diving. We took a boat tour to a nearby coral reef and spent hours exploring the underwater world. Our children were fascinated by the colorful fish and sea turtles swimming around us. We even saw a few reef sharks, but they were harmless and kept their distance.

2. Lagoon Tour: We took a lagoon tour on a glass-bottom boat, which allowed us to see the marine life without getting wet. Our guide pointed out different types of fish, coral, and even a few stingrays swimming beneath us. The tour also included a stop at a small island where we could swim and play on the beach. Our children loved searching for seashells and building sandcastles.

3. 4x4 Safari Tour: We took a 4x4 safari tour of the island, which allowed us to see some of the more remote areas of Bora Bora. Our guide took us to a lookout point where we could see the entire island, as well as a few local villages and plantations. We even got to sample some fresh coconut water and try our hand at making coconut oil. Our children enjoyed the bumpy ride and the chance to see some of the island's wildlife, including wild chickens and pigs.

4. Beach Day: We spent a day at Matira Beach, which is considered one of the best beaches in Bora Bora. The water was warm and shallow, making it perfect for our children to play in. We set up a picnic on the beach and spent the day swimming, building sandcastles, and playing games. There were also plenty of opportunities for water sports, such as kayaking and paddleboarding, but we opted to just relax and enjoy the scenery.

5. Polynesian Cultural Show: We attended a Polynesian cultural show at one of the local resorts. The show featured traditional music, dance, and costumes, and our children were mesmerized by the performers. We even got to participate in a few of the dances and learn some of the moves. It was a great way to learn about the local culture and have fun at the same time.

Overall, we had a fantastic time in Bora Bora and would highly recommend it for families with children. There are plenty of activities to keep everyone entertained, and the island's natural beauty is truly breathtaking. We can't wait to go back and explore more of what Bora Bora has to offer.
