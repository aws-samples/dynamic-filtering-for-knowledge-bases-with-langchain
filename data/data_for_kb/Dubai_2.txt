I'm a 65-year-old retiree who recently visited Dubai with my husband. I've been to many places, but Dubai is unlike any other city I've ever visited. Here are some of the popular tourist attractions and fun things to do in Dubai for seniors like me:

The Dubai Mall:

The Dubai Mall is the world's largest shopping mall, and it's a must-visit for any tourist in Dubai. It has over 1,200 stores, a massive aquarium, an ice rink, and a cinema complex. I spent a whole day here and still didn't get to see everything. The mall also has plenty of restaurants and cafes, so you can take a break and recharge whenever you need to.

Dubai Fountain:

The Dubai Fountain is located outside the Dubai Mall and is the world's largest choreographed fountain system. The fountain show is a spectacular sight to behold, with water jets reaching up to 500 feet in the air. The show is set to music, and it's a great way to spend a few minutes relaxing and taking in the sights.

Dubai Museum:

The Dubai Museum is located in the Al Fahidi Fort, which is one of the oldest buildings in Dubai. The museum provides a fascinating insight into the history and culture of Dubai, from its early days as a fishing village to its current status as a global city. The museum has a wide range of exhibits, including traditional Arab houses, mosques, and souks.

Dubai Creek:

Dubai Creek is a saltwater creek that runs through the heart of Dubai. It's a great place to take a stroll and soak up the local atmosphere. You can take a traditional abra boat ride across the creek, which is a fun and affordable way to see the city from a different perspective. There are also plenty of restaurants and cafes along the creek, so you can stop for a bite to eat or a cup of coffee.

Desert Safari:

One of the most popular activities in Dubai is the desert safari. You can choose from a variety of packages, including dune bashing, camel riding, and sandboarding. The safari usually includes a traditional Arabic dinner and a belly dancing show. It's a great way to experience the desert and get a taste of local culture.

In conclusion, Dubai is a fantastic destination for seniors. There's something for everyone, from shopping and sightseeing to adventure and culture. I highly recommend visiting the Dubai Mall, the Dubai Fountain, the Dubai Museum, and Dubai Creek. And if you're looking for a unique experience, don't miss out on the desert safari.
