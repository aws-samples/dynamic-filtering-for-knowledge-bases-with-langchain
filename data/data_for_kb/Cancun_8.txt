As a 35-year-old mother of two, I recently visited Cancun with my family and had an amazing time. Here are some of the popular tourist attractions and fun things to do in Cancun that we enjoyed:

Xcaret Park: This eco-archaeological park is a must-visit for families with children. We spent a full day exploring the park's many attractions, including swimming with dolphins, snorkeling in underground rivers, and visiting ancient Mayan ruins. My kids loved the animal sanctuary, where they got to see jaguars, monkeys, and other exotic animals up close. We also enjoyed the cultural shows, which featured traditional Mexican music and dance.

Chichen Itza: This ancient Mayan city is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. We took a guided tour of the site, which allowed us to learn about the history and significance of the various structures, including the famous El Castillo pyramid. My kids were fascinated by the ball court, where ancient Mayans played a game similar to soccer, and the observatory, where they could see the stars through ancient telescopes.

Aquaworld: This water sports center offers a variety of activities for families, including snorkeling, scuba diving, and jet skiing. We took a snorkeling tour of the nearby coral reef, where we saw colorful fish and sea turtles. My kids also enjoyed the banana boat ride, which was a fun and exciting way to see the beautiful Cancun coastline.

Coco Bongo: This famous nightclub is a must-visit for families who want to experience Cancun's nightlife. The club features live music, dancing, and acrobatic performances, and the atmosphere is electric. My kids loved the laser show and the confetti cannons, and we all had a great time dancing the night away.

Overall, we had an amazing time in Cancun and would highly recommend it to families with children. There are so many fun things to do and see, and the city has a great mix of culture, adventure, and relaxation. We can't wait to go back!
