As a mother of two young children, I recently had the pleasure of visiting Cancun with my family. We spent a week exploring the area and had a fantastic time. Here are some of the popular tourist attractions and fun things to do in Cancun that I would recommend for families with children.

First, we visited the Cancun Underwater Museum (MUSA). This unique attraction features over 500 life-sized sculptures submerged in the crystal-clear waters of the Cancun National Marine Park. We took a glass-bottom boat tour to see the sculptures up close and even had the opportunity to snorkel among them. My kids, aged 5 and 7, were fascinated by the sculptures and loved seeing the colorful fish swimming around them.

Next, we spent a day at Xcaret Eco Park. This park offers a variety of activities for families, including swimming in underground rivers, visiting a butterfly pavilion, and watching traditional Mexican dances. We also took a boat ride through a mangrove forest and saw a variety of wildlife, including iguanas, monkeys, and jaguars. My kids loved the water activities and the chance to learn about Mexican culture.

Another highlight of our trip was visiting the Mayan ruins at Chichen Itza. This ancient city is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. We took a guided tour of the site and learned about the history and culture of the Mayan people. My kids were fascinated by the pyramids and temples and loved climbing up the steps to get a view of the surrounding area.

Finally, we spent a day at the Aquaworld water park. This park features a variety of water slides, pools, and activities for all ages. My kids loved the wave pool and the lazy river, and we all had a blast on the water slides. The park also offers snorkeling and scuba diving excursions, but we opted to just relax and enjoy the water park.

Overall, we had a fantastic time in Cancun and would highly recommend it for families with children. There are plenty of activities to keep everyone entertained, and the beaches and water are beautiful. We can't wait to go back and explore more of this amazing destination!
